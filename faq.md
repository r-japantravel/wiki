#FAQ

##Language and Etiquette 

###I don't speak Japanese! Can I still go to Japan?

Many travelers assume that speaking no Japanese will inhibit them while traveling in Japan. While this might have been true in the 1980s and 1990s, recent advances in technology (ie: Google translate app, Japanese-English Dictionary Apps) and an increase in foreign tourism (ie: more English on signs) have made Japan a relatively easy place to travel for non-Japanese speakers. In major cities, English can be found in all major train stations, on major street signs and public maps and even on some restaurant menus.

However, outside of major tourist areas, English support and signage will be limited. It's also important to note that not every restaurant or store in major tourist zones will have English menus or signs — so don't get flustered when you run into language issues, even if you're in Tokyo.

For those travelers who wish to study the basics of Japanese before arriving in Japan, a list of helpful phrases can be found on the [\/r/JapanTravel General Advice page](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/wiki/advice#wiki_helpful_japanese_phrases). A small phrase book might also be useful, but it's by no means a requirement. /r/LearnJapanese is a decent resource as well and has guides to suggest apps or textbooks for those who want to go beyond the basics.

###What should I wear in Japan?

Please see the information in the FAQ on historical weather forecasts to get a general idea of how warmly you will need to dress during a particular time of year.

As there is a considerable amount of walking required in both cities and rural areas, consider bringing one or two pairs of comfortable, sturdy walking shoes. Those traveling in winter might want to bring a comfortable pair of boots or snow shoes instead. Tennis shoes or trainers are commonly worn by both locals and tourists, but sturdy sandals (no flip flops) and more fashionable walking shoes are also an option. High heels are discouraged except for occasions where one may need to dress up (ie: dinner at a fancy restaurant).

Individuals traveling during summer may want to consider lightweight clothing that is breathable and dries easily. Individuals traveling during the rainy season may want to invest in a lightweight, breathable waterproof jacket or windbreaker. 

Contrary to popular belief, Japanese fashion errs towards the conservative and not the outlandish or zany. In fact, individuals in Japan who dress in fashions popular in Western media (ie: Lolita, Visual Kei, Dolly) are seen as outsiders by the wider Japanese public. Remember, these are niche communities of people, and these styles and trends are by no means mainstream. The average Japanese man or woman will generally be seen wearing plain, modest and "classic" styles of clothing. Browsing websites like [ZOZOTOWN](http://zozo.jp/) will give travelers a good idea of what styles are currently popular throughout the country, and might help with vacation wardrobe planning.

Unfortunately, the unspoken rules that dictate what types of clothing are deemed acceptable by a wider audience skew heavily towards the clothing worn by women. Generally speaking, as long as male travelers wear clothing that is not obscene or revealing (ie: nothing exposing the genitals, no shirtless attire, no fetish gear), they will face no scorn or criticism while in Japan. 

Japanese women generally do not wear clothing that exposes their cleavage (ie: v-neck tops, scoop tops), and skin-tight clothing is a rarity. Strapless clothing and bare shoulders on women are also a rare sight. Many Japanese women wear t-shirts underneath tank tops and spaghetti strap tops to provide additional coverage. Items such as very short crop tops or bralettes should never be worn in public, as these are considered underwear and/or inappropriate for public settings. Wearing yoga pants or leggings without a dress or tunic to cover the buttocks is also discouraged. Short skirts, dresses and shorts, however, are a common sight and are acceptable to wear as long as the genitals or buttocks are not exposed. Dresses and jeans are a common wardrobe staple for Japanese women and acceptable for everyday wear.

In situations where a swimsuit would be worn, bikinis and Speedos are acceptable. However, women's bathing suits that are high-cut in the rear (such as Brazillian bikinis) should be left at home. Full coverage is best where bottoms are concerned. (Note: Individuals with tattoos should ensure the facility they wish to visit allows tattoos. Many beaches and pools prohibit tattoos, even if covered by clothing or a bandage.)

## Scheduling Your Trip

###When is a good season (weather-wise) to travel to Japan?

[JapanGuide's "When To Travel" page is helpful](http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2273.html) as a basic overview of weather patterns in Japan. Weather can vary wildly by region, so it's important to consider where you'll be traveling in addition to when (ie: Tokyo in January is cold, but relatively mild with little to no snow and temperatures ranging from 1 Celsius to 9 Celsius in the daytime, dipping around 0 Celsius to -5 Celsius in the evenings. However, Hokkaido in January is extremely snowy and daytime temperatures rarely hit above 1 Celsius.)

Generally speaking, spring and fall are pleasant and mild. Summer is hot and muggy. Winter is cold and unpredictable. Obviously, Okinawa is the exception, as the island is sub-tropical and, thus, has much warmer temperatures and no snow.

If you have a basic itinerary, you might consider referencing [historical weather forecasts](https://www.google.com/search?q=historical+weather+forecast+japan&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&gws_rd=cr,ssl&ei=BkjBVsGZNMbUjwPpnqSQDQ) for the areas you plan to visit to get a better idea of the weather patterns.

###What national holidays/high travel seasons should I avoid?

Check out [this list of festivals](http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2063.html) and [this list of holidays](http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2062.html) from JapanGuide.

###When should I start booking flights and accommodations?

It all depends on when and where you intend to visit. At minimum, you should plan to book flights and accommodations 1-3 months in advance of the actual trip date. However, if parts of your visit falls during Japanese national holidays and/or major festivals, start booking at least 3-6 months in advance. Of course, low airfare can occur at any time — so it's smart to subscribe to an airfare newsletter or set up automatic alerts to be notified when tickets are in your desired price range. Popular websites that offer this service include (but are not limited to): [Airfare Watchdog](http://www.airfarewatchdog.com/), [Adioso](http://adioso.com) and [Kayak](http://www.kayak.com/).

###What should I book in advance?

Certain attractions and events require advanced booking and/or ticket purchases, including: Studio Ghibli Museum, sumo wrestling, major concerts, sporting events for popular teams (ie: Hiroshima Carps), Universal Studios Japan Universal Express Pass, Yamazaki Distillery tour, Fujiko F. Fujio Museum, etc. 

Most information about ticket sales can be found on the official website of certain museums and attractions, so it is best to check with these sources several months prior to your trip to ensure tickets can be purchased.

###When can I see cherry blossoms?

Sakura season generally begins in Tokyo in late March, expanding to the rest of the country by early to mid April. The sakura season generally only lasts 1-2 weeks. More information can be found at [JNTO guide](https://www.jnto.go.jp/sakura/eng/index.php) and [Japan Guide](http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2011_when.html).

###How many days should I spend in [city]?

This is entirely subjective and depends entirely upon an individual traveler's preferences, budget, interests etc. However, here are some **suggested** lengths of stay in popular tourist destinations to give you a **rough** idea of how much time can be spent in one location in Japan. You may want to spend more or less time in a particular location — which is totally fine. These are intended to be minimum guides that take into account seeing major tourist sights/neighborhoods.

* Tokyo: 5-7 days

* Kyoto: 3-7 days

* Osaka: 1-3 days

* Hiroshima/Miyajima: 2 days, one for each location

* Hokkaido: 5-7 days

* Okinawa: 4-7 days

* Kanazawa: 2-3 days

* Hakone/Fuji Five Lakes: 2-3 days

## Currency

###Where should I convert my home currency into Yen?

The easiest and best method to obtain Yen is to obtain it upon arrival in Japan, either by using an ATM or a currency exchange counter. Obtaining Yen in your home country is inadvisable as the fees and exchange rate will not be as friendly to travelers as they will in Japan itself. 

All major International entry points have currency conversion desks or bank branches that can convert currency for you. As you will almost certainly need cash to pay for transportation from the airport to your lodging, it is best to obtain some cash at the airport if possible. The rates at Japanese airport kiosks are reasonable, though the best rates you'll get are from ATM withdrawals. If possible, you may want to open a bank account with no foreign transaction or ATM fees. The majority of travelers obtain cash from ATMs using a debit card (also called a cash card in some counties) instead of paying for a cash advance on a credit card. Please note that debit cards and credit cards are different. Debit cards typically pull from a bank account, while credit cards function much like a loan. It is best to inquire with your bank about your account capabilities and functions of your cards prior to travel if you do not know which type of card you have.

You should always have at least ¥5000 in cash on your person. Many places still do not accept credit card.

###Which ATMs can I use?

[Seven Bank ATMs](http://www.sevenbank.co.jp/intlcard/index2.html) (7-Eleven branded) accept most international ATM cards. Please see the Seven Bank website for compatibility. Seven Bank ATMs are located in all Japanese international airports and in every 7-Eleven convenience store. The maximum you can withdraw in one transaction for most accounts is ¥50,000 — but some cards can withdraw amounts up to ￥100,000.

Some travelers report success withdrawing money from [FamilyMart ATMs](http://www.family.co.jp/for_tourist/en.html) or [Japan Post Bank ATMs](http://www.jp-bank.japanpost.jp/en/ias/en_ias_index.html) — although many travelers report issues with both withdrawal methods. It is best to check with your bank and card issuer to see if your bank is supported by the networked used at these ATMs.

**You must tell your bank before you leave your home country that you are going to Japan.** Otherwise, you might have your transactions denied. It is also smart to confirm what fees your bank may charge for international transactions. These fee might include:  International transaction fees, out-of-network ATM usage fees, ATM withdrawal fees, currency exchange fees etc.

##Budgeting

###How much money should I bring to Japan?

Although Japan has a reputation for being an expensive country to both visit and live in, this is a largely outdated stereotype that has become less true as Japan's economy has destabilized following the economic boom in the 1980s and as the cost of the yen has dropped relative to other major currencies. With proper planning and a good understanding of your average daily spending habits, it is entirely possible to visit Japan without breaking the bank — that is, unless, you want to splurge on your trip!

Creating an inflexible and immutable budget is by no needs necessary. However, allowing yourself to develop a rough idea of how much you may need to bring on your trip is not only smart, but may also prevent you from getting into troubling or stressful situations — especially for first-time travelers to Japan or those with little international travel experience. There's nothing worse than running out of money during the middle of a vacation.

Please see our designated [Budget Planning](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/wiki/advice/budget/budgeting) page for more information.

##Arriving in Japan

###How long does it take to get in/out of an Airport?

There isn't really any way to answer this question exactly. Between 1 and 3 hours, generally. What you've packed in your luggage can how long it takes.  How many flights there are around the same time as yours can impact time. How many people are working at the airport to do customs/immigration can impact time.   Etc..  There's a lot of variance, often caused by factors you're not aware of or in control of.

A good rule of thumb is to allow for a lot of extra time at the airport, and then be pleasantly surprised if you don't need it.  Don't plan on a tight schedule surrounding arrival/departure.

###How does the immigration process work?

*This section assumes you are entering as a tourist, on a [visa waiver](http://www.mofa.go.jp/j_info/visit/visa/short/novisa.html). If you are from a country that does not have a visa waiver agreement with Japan, or you are not entering as a tourist, you must apply in advance for the appropriate visa (for tourists, Temporary Visitor) and this section does not apply to you. Please visit the [Tourist Visa and Visa Waiver](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/wiki/advice/visas) page for more specific information.*

Most airlines will not permit individuals to fly to Japan unless passengers are in possession of either a return ticket or a ticket leaving Japan within the visa waiver time frame. Visa waivers on arrival are issued entirely at the discretion of immigration inspectors — so it is possible that these inspectors may also ask for documentation of a return/exiting flight upon arrival in Japan. It is prudent to have a return ticket booked, but it is not required.

Tourists who are citizens of countries entered into a visa waiver agreement with Japan only need to bring their passport to be admitted to Japan. Please also have a copy of the address of your lodging on your person as you will need it to fill out the required immigration and customs forms.

A facial photo and fingerprints of both your index fingers will be taken before your passport is stamped.

You cannot stay in Japan more than 180 days out of every 365 on a Temporary Visitor visa. While no officially published policy or law regarding this time limit exists, reports are universal that Japanese Immigration enforces this 180 day rule. As such, /r/JapanTravel does not endorse "visa runs" or other methods of getting around this time limit.

###What can I bring or not bring to Japan?

Japanese Customs restricts several classes of items from entering the country. Other items, such as plants or animals, are subject to importation regulation. To prevent problems upon arrival in Japan, it is best to ensure you are not in possession of anything that is prohibited. controlled or requires a quarantine procedure. [Please check this list provided by the Consulate-General of Japan in Seattle](http://www.seattle.us.emb-japan.go.jp/about/import_restrictions.html) to see what is specifically covered by these rules.

For specific information on the importation of medication into Japan for personal use, please consult the [Health and Prescription Drugs](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/wiki/faqs/japantravel#wiki_health_and_prescription_drugs) section of this FAQ.

##Technology

###What kind of power adapter/converter do I need ?

Japan uses 100V, 50/60Hz power and uses an ungrounded (2-pin) NEMA Type A 5-15 plug. Some North American consumer appliances will work fine in Japan without an adapter. However, certain equipment — especially consumer appliances involving heating (e.g. hair dryers, curling irons) — may not work properly or may even get damaged. 

Tourists from outside North America (ie: from countries where standard voltage is in the range of 220-240 V) **will need to use a power converter** while traveling in Japan. If you are from the US, Canada, Mexico or another country that uses a standard voltage 110 - 127 V, **you will not need a power converter**. These tourists, however, may want to purchase a [three prong to two prong converter](https://www.google.co.jp/search?q=two+prong+to+three+prong&rlz=1C1GGRV_enJP751JP751&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjLnIq5mKHWAhXExbwKHXtsASsQ_AUICygC&biw=1493&bih=791&dpr=1.13) for any chargers or appliances that require a ground (ie: laptop chargers).

If you intend to purchase electronic appliances in Japan for use outside of Japan, you are advised to look for equipment specifically made for overseas tourists, as the use of Japanese appliances abroad will require the purchase and use of a transformer. For more information, see this [BiC Camera page about power on consumer products produced in Japan](http://www.biccamera.com.e.lj.hp.transer.com/bc/c/info/purchase/transformer.jsp).

###Is there free public wi-fi available in Japan?

Public wi-fi in Japan is generally limited to people who have service with a Japanese cell phone provider. As the 2020 Olympics approaches, public wi-fi connections are becoming more widely available at places like train stations and popular tourists spots — but it’s still hard to find outside major tourist areas. It is best to not rely on public wi-fi accessibility as the connections are unstable, slow and generally unreliable. Because of this, many users who do not have international or favorable roaming plans with their home cell provider opt to rent a **pocket wi-fi** or **SIM card**.

[More information, including price comparisons, can be found at the designated pocket wi-fi and SIM card page](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/wiki/advice/pocketwifi). Please note that the price comparison information on this page was user-submitted and may not be accurate. It is always important to back up information with your own research.

###Should I get a pocket wi-fi?

A popular choice among tourists, especially those traveling as a couple/small group or those without an unlocked cell phone, is pocket wi-fi. A pocket wi-fi is a personal hotspot device, about the size of a flip phone, that provides wi-fi access to items such as phones, tablets and laptops via a secured wi-fi network. The devices are rechargeable and, depending on your usage, can use power quickly. Therefore, it is recommended to carry either a portable battery (easily found at any electronics store) or the pocket wi-fi charger on your person during your trip.

Pocket wi-fi can be rented in advance (for airport pickup) or upon arrival in Japan at any major airport. Pocket wi-fi plans are usually tiered by download/upload speed, max number of connected devices and battery life (ie: a 75mbps wi-fi that allows 4 connected devices with a battery life of 10 hours.)

For pros and cons of pocket wi-fi, please [visit the designated pocket wi-fi and SIM card page](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/wiki/advice/pocketwifi).

###Should I get a SIM card?

For travelers with unlocked cell phones, an MVNO SIM card is an easy option as it allows you to utilize Japanese cell towers without incurring roaming charges and eliminates the need to carry a second device and charger. However, if your phone is on contract with a service provider in your home country (ie: "locked") then you will be unable to use a SIM card in Japan. When buying a SIM card, be sure to select the proper SIM card size that is compatible with your phone. Many retailers or service providers do not allow exchanges if the wrong size is purchased.

SIM Cards can either be rented in advance — many pocket wi-fi providers also rent SIM cards — or purchased upon arrival in Japan at the airport or at any major electronics retailer. SIM cards are usually tiered by amount of data and length of validity (ie: a 10GB card good for 14 days).

For pros and cons of SIM cards, please [visit the designated pocket wi-fi and SIM card page](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/wiki/advice/pocketwifi).

###Where/how can I rent a pocket wi-fi or SIM card?

Please [visit the designated pocket wi-fi and SIM card page](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/wiki/advice/pocketwifi) for a list of SIM card and pocket wi-fi rental companies. The websites linked on this page contain information on each company's individual rental process. 

Many SIM cards and pocket wi-fi devices can be picked up upon arrival at any major airport in Japan with advanced reservation. Most companies requires at least 2-3 days advanced notice to arrange airport pickup, so it is best to make a reservation with your intended rental company well in advance of your arrival to ensure your device will be in-stock. Some rental services also allow for delivery of SIM cards and pocket wi-fi units to hotels. During the rental process, be sure to include your name and dates of stay to help hotel staff assign your mail correctly. Sending a SIM card or wi-fi to an AirBnb is **not recommended**, as most Japanese mail providers require mail to be delivered only in the name of the legal occupant of the house or apartment, and most will not leave packages if someone is not present to receive them. If you are staying at an AirBnb, please arrange to pick up your SIM card or wi-fi at the airport.

SIM cards and pocket wi-fi units can also be rented directly from companies at some major airports, but it is important to note that selection is limited and there is no guarantee of device availability — especially in high tourism seasons.

If you want to purchase a SIM card once you are in Japan, they can be found at many large electronics stores and some convenience stores. Check out [this article](https://tokyocheapo.com/business/internet/prepaid-cheap-japan-sim-card-options/) for more information about exactly where and how to buy SIM cards if you do not wish to obtain a SIM card at the airport.

### I have a cell phone provider that gives me free international data in other countries. Will that work well in Japan? 

Several U.S. cell phone providers (including T-Mobile, Sprint, and Google Fi) offer international data roaming as an added feature in certain tiers of service plans. Please check that your cell phone plan includes free access to international roaming, as international roaming can be extremely costly if not included in your service agreement. 

Most foreign cell phone phone providers roam on one of the major networks in Japan, such as docomo or SoftBank. Coverage should generally be available in major and minor cities — although speed and quality will vary.

In general, international roaming works well enough in Japan for basic tasks such as loading maps and sending text messages. However, some visitors report problems using more complex functions such as social media applications or web browsers. For more information, including recent reviews of international data roaming, please read these previous posts about [T-Mobile](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/search?q=t-mobile&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all), [Sprint](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/search?q=sprint&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all), and [Google Fi](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/search?q=google+fi&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all) connectivity. 

## Health and Prescription Drugs

### What vaccines should I get before going to Japan?

**There are no mandatory vaccines for the average traveler**. You should, however, be current on all your local vaccines before traveling to Japan. 

Depending on your travel plans, you may consider obtaining the following vaccines:

 * **Hepatitis A and B** - This vaccine should be obtained if you intend to engage in high risk activities that may put you into contact with either virus. High risk activities that spread hepatitis can include sexual contact (ie: sex trade activities, unprotected sex), medical treatment, sharing needles, tattooing, acupuncture or occupational exposure.

 * **Japanese encephalitis** - This vaccine is recommended for travelers going to Japan for more than one month who will be traveling in extremely rural areas or areas dense with mosquitoes and will spend their time primarily outdoors (ie: backpackers, those going on a WWOOF exchange). This disease is transmitted through mosquitoes.

 * **Rabies** - This vaccine is only recommended if you are visiting rural areas and will be in contact with wild animals — in particular, bats. 

If you will not be participating in the above activities or traveling to areas mentioned above, then you will not need to obtain any additional vaccines to travel to Japan. 90% of tourists will not need these additional vaccines.

###Can I bring my prescription drugs with me to Japan?

It depends.

The importation of prescription drugs and other medical substances/devices into Japan is controlled by the Pharmaceutical Affairs Law and Customs Law. This law is a strict pharmaceutical import procedure that is dictated by two factors: The chemical ingredients of a drug and the amount of the drug imported.

Prescription drugs fall under three categories: **Prohibited**, meaning completely banned; **Controlled**, meaning allowed with certain provisions; and **free prescription or quasi-drugs** which can be imported in certain quantities without obtaining prior permission.

A **quasi-drug** is a product that can be obtained without a prescription, has a restricted purpose of use, has a mild action on the human body and is not categorized as a medical device (ie: ointments, eye drops, ibuprofen). These are commonly known as "over-the-counter" drugs in other countries.

If your prescription is a controlled substance, you will need to complete and submit a form called a **[Yakkan Shoumei](http://www.mhlw.go.jp/english/policy/health-medical/pharmaceuticals/dl/qa1.pdf)** to the Bureau of Health and Welfare office at the airport you will first land at in Japan.

If you are bringing in **more than the permitted supply of free prescriptions**, you will also need a Yakkan Shoumei.

Individuals who have a prescription for narcotics that fall under Japan's controlled substance law (see below for specifics) must also fill out a **[narcotics-specific form](http://www.ncd.mhlw.go.jp/dl_data/keitai/keitai_guideh26.pdf)** in addition to the Yakkan Shoumei. This form is submitted to the Narcotics Control Department of the Japan Bureau of Health and Welfare.

It is important to note that there are **no exceptions** to the Pharmaceutical Affairs Law and Customs Law, no matter what your medical condition or needs may entail. Thus, if you regularly take prescription medication, it is extremely important to verify that your medication is permissible in Japan prior to making any travel reservations.

When bringing medications to Japan, it is advised that tourists keep any pills or substances in their original packaging or bottles.

###What is a 'Yakkan Shoumei'?

A **[Yakkan Shoumei](http://www.mhlw.go.jp/english/policy/health-medical/pharmaceuticals/dl/qa1.pdf)** is an import certificate specifically for certain prescription medications and over-the-counter medical drugs/devices that is issued by the Japanese Bureau of Health and Welfare. This certificate must be declared to customs, along with your medication, when you arrive in Japan.

**A Yakkan Shoumei must be obtained prior to arrival in Japan**. Please give yourself ample time to receive the authorized Yakkan Shoumei from Japanese officials. You should obtain your Yakkan Shoumei no less than two weeks before you trip. If you have less time than two weeks, please email your application to the proper Japan Bureau of Health and Welfare office and call your local Japanese embassy or consulate for additional guidance.

More information about the Yakkan Shoumei, along with the application form, can be found on the [Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare website](http://www.mhlw.go.jp/english/policy/health-medical/pharmaceuticals/dl/qa1.pdf).

###How do I know if I need a 'Yakkan Shoumei'?

If your prescription is a **[controlled substance](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/wiki/faqs/japantravel/medicine#wiki_controlled_drugs)** and you will be bringing in more than the permitted amount, you will need to complete and submit a form called a **[Yakkan Shoumei](http://www.mhlw.go.jp/english/policy/health-medical/pharmaceuticals/dl/qa1.pdf)** to the Bureau of Health and Welfare office at the airport you will first land at in Japan.

Individuals who have a prescription for narcotics that fall under Japan's controlled substance law (see below for specifics) must also fill out a **[narcotics-specific form](http://www.ncd.mhlw.go.jp/dl_data/keitai/keitai_guideh26.pdf)** in addition to the Yakkan Shoumei. This form is submitted to the Narcotics Control Department of the Japan Bureau of Health and Welfare.

Individuals bringing medications designated as **free prescriptions** (ie: birth control, asthma inhalers, Epi pens etc.) and will have a 30 day supply or less of the medication do not need any special permission or paperwork. If you will be bringing in more than a 30 day supply of your prescription, you will need a [Yakkan Shoumei](http://www.mhlw.go.jp/english/policy/health-medical/pharmaceuticals/dl/qa1.pdf) — even if the drug is legal.

For **quasi-drugs and medical devices** (ie: syringes, ibuprofen, anti-diarrheals, eye drops) a 2 month supply is permitted without the need for additional paperwork. Anything more than a 2 month supply would require a Yakkan Shoumei. A quasi-drug is commonly known as an "over-the-counter" drug in other countries.

###How can I determine if my prescription is a prohibited, controlled or free substance?

To see if your prescription or over-the-counter medication is legal in Japan, you will first need to verify the main chemical ingredient (scientific name or generic name) of the medication. (For example: The generic name for Xanax is Alprazolam. The generic name for Zoloft is Sertraline.)

If the chemical is on the [**prohibited substances list**](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/wiki/faqs/japantravel/medicine#wiki_strictly_prohibited), you **cannot** bring it into Japan. There is no exception to this rule, no matter what you medical condition or needs may entail. Importing prohibited pharmaceutical substances are akin to carrying illegal street drugs (ie: heroin, cocaine) on your person into a country where they are illegal.

If the chemical is on the [**controlled substances list**](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/wiki/faqs/japantravel/medicine#wiki_controlled_drugs) and you will be bringing in more than the permitted amount, you will need a Yakkan Shoumei.

If your prescription and its active ingredient is not on either list, then it is a **free prescription**. Please refer to ["How do I know if I need a 'Yakkan Shoumei'?"](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/wiki/faqs/japantravel#wiki_how_do_i_know_if_i_need_a_.27yakkan_shoumei.27.3F) for information.

###How do I get a 'Yakkan Shoumei'?

All the information regarding the Yakkan Shoumei process, along with the application form, can be found on the [Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare website](http://www.mhlw.go.jp/english/policy/health-medical/pharmaceuticals/dl/qa1.pdf). This link also includes the mailing, fax and email addresses of the regional Japan Bureau of Health and Welfare offices.

###What happens if I come to Japan with my prescriptions and without a 'Yakkan Shoumei'?

If you come to Japan with controlled substances or an excess of a free prescription without prior declaration, you are subject to have your medications confiscated. You might also be fined, deported from Japan or jailed.

Those who bring prohibited substances to Japan will be jailed immediately.

###Is my favorite cold medicine considered a quasi-drug in Japan?

This depends entirely on the drug and it's ingredients.

Many legal over-the-counter drugs sold in other countries are illegal in Japan because they contain stimulants — which are considered prohibited substances in Japan. These are generally medicines sold to combat the symptoms of the common cold or flu.

Some of these prohibited drugs include: Tylenol Cold, NyQuil, NyQuil Liquicaps, Actifed, Sudafed, Advil Cold & Sinus, Dristan Cold, Dristan Sinus, Drixoral Sinus, Vicks Inhaler or Lomotil.

Please compare the active ingredients in your medication to the prohibited and controlled substance lists above to verify if your over-the-counter drug is permitted in Japan.

###Can I bring my ADHD medication to Japan?

Prescription medication that contains Methamphetamine, Amphetamine, Dexamphetamine or any other stimulant is classified as a **prohibited substance** and **cannot** be brought into Japan under any circumstances. If your medication contains any of these ingredients, you must leave it at home and could face deportation, detention and/or prosecution if found to be in possession of these substances upon arrival in Japan.

If you medication does not contain Methamphetamine, Amphetamine, Dexamphetamine or any other banned stimulant used to treat ADHD, please refer to the [**controlled substances list**](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/wiki/faqs/japantravel/medicine#wiki_controlled_drugs) to see if it requires a Yakkan Shoumei or is legal in Japan.

###Where can I find Post-Exposure Prophylaxis (Emergency Anti-HIV) drugs in Japan?

[Please read this extremely thorough post containing a first-hand account by one of our users](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/6pdmqk/what_to_do_when_you_need_postexposure_prophylaxis/). Post-Exposure While prophylaxis drugs are available in Japan, they are also extremely expensive and might be difficult to obtain based upon your location. It is best to practice safe sex via condom use to prevent the spread of HIV or other STDs if you engage in sexual activity in Japan.

##Airport Transportation

###How do I get from the airport to my lodging?

Please refer to our designated **[Airport Transportation](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/wiki/advice/airport/transportation)** page, which includes a comprehensive guide for transportation to and from **Narita Airport**, **Haneda Airport**, **Kansai Airport**, **Shin-Chitose Airport** (also called New Chitose Airport) and **Fukuoka Airport**.

This guide includes a breakdown of all available transportation options, prices, schedules, and links to individual services.

##Luggage

###Can I bring my luggage on the train/bus?

It depends. 

If you are utilizing a train that services an airport (ie: Narita Express, Skyliner), these trains generally offer ample luggage storage space — both at the front and rear of the car (with combination locks) and as luggage racks in the main cabin. There is often also enough space between your seat and the seat in front of you to store luggage.

If you need to transfer to a local line upon completing your airport train journey, it is entirely possible to bring your luggage onto your next train. However, it is important to note that the luggage racks on non-airport trains are too small to hold large suitcases and are best for backpacks or duffel bags. If you have large luggage (ie: rolling luggage), you should hold your luggage to the front or side of you without impeding into the path or space of other passengers. Many people who utilize trains while using luggage stick to the front or rear cars, as these offer a large open area for strollers, wheelchair users, etc. that makes standing with luggage slightly easier.

Many Japanese people bring luggage onto trains, so do not worry about committing a social *faux pas*. You should, however, be as courteous as possible and refrain from taking up seat space or excessive aisle space with your luggage.

Unless you are taking a designated airport bus to or from an airport, it is unlikely your bus will have room or luggage. Japanese buses are quite narrow and can fill up easily.

Should you not want to deal with carrying your suitcases, please [consider luggage forwarding](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/wiki/faqs/japantravel#wiki_how_can_i_forward_my_luggage_to_the_airport_or_to_my_next_destination.3F).

###Where can I store my luggage while sightseeing?

For those travelers with luggage waiting for their lodging's check-in time, luggage may be able to be kept at the front desk or in a secured room at the hotel or hostel. This is a relatively common practice, so please inquire with your lodging facility prior to check-in.

For travelers waiting for AirBnb check-in, train departures, or who cannot store luggage at a place of lodging, **coin lockers** are generally available at all train stations. **[Coin Locker Search](http://coinlockersearch.com/)** contains information and maps for coin lockers at most major stations across Japan. (Please note: This website is in Japanese only. If you cannot type or read Japanese, please use a browser like Google Chrome to auto-translate.) If you cannot find your station on Coin Locker Search,, try performing an Internet search for "[NAME OF STATION IN JAPANESE] ロッカー". 

The price of lockers vary based on size and can range from ¥300 to ¥700. Some lockers are cash only and will only accept coins, while others will accept IC Card payment (ie: Suica, PASMO) or larger bills.

It is very important to note that the size and availability of lockers can vary between stations. While many major and semi-major stations offer large lockers (usually big enough to hold a 27" suitcase), many local or smaller stations do not. Additionally, the selection of lockers at major stations will be extremely limited on weekends or holidays. Large lockers are popular with both foreign and Japanese travelers, so these lockers tend to fill up quickly. Do not rely upon the availability of lockers and have a back-up plan or back-up station for your luggage storage. 

Travelers visiting Shinjuku, Tokyo Station, Tokyo Sky Tree or Asakusa may also utilize a relatively new **[baggage storage service from Sagawa Express](http://www.sagawa-exp.co.jp/ttk/english/)**, a major Japanese courier service. Price and hours of operation vary by location, so please refer to the Sagawa Express website for more information.

Tokyo Station's **[JR East Travel Service Center](https://www.jreast.co.jp/e/customer_support/service_center_tokyo.html)** also offers temporary baggage storage. The cost is ¥600 per item. Baggage storage is available from 7:30 to 20:30 daily and items must be retrieved before closing. The JR East Travel Service center also offers a porter service for travelers utilizing the Narita Express, Shinkansen, Limousine Bus and other methods of transport. Please see the previous link for more information.

For Kyoto and Osaka, **[Crosta](https://handsfree-japan.com/en/about/)** offers short-term luggage storage at both Kyoto Station (8:00 to 20:00 daily) and Shin-Osaka Station (9:00 to 20:00 daily). The fee is ￥700 per item, per day, and luggage can be stored for up to 15 days. 

If you are on a layover and will be returning to the same airport as your arrival flight, you may want to utilize an airport baggage storage service. Several airports offer this service as follows:

 - Travelers transiting through Narita Airport can store luggage at **[Narita's Baggage Storage](https://www.narita-airport.jp/en/service/svc_06)**. Bags may be stored here up to 29 days. Prices vary by size of the item.

 - **[Haneda Airport International Passenger Terminal](http://www.haneda-airport.jp/inter/en/premises/service/delivery.html#temporary)** offers temporary baggage storage for up to 2 weeks. Prices range from ¥200 to ¥800 depending on the size of the item.

 - **[Kansai International Airport Terminal 1](http://www.kansai-airport.or.jp/en/service/baggage/)** offers temporary baggage storage, although no storage time limit is specified on the airport's website. Storing a basic suitcase costs ¥620 per day, while large items such as surfboards can be left for ¥1030 per day.  **[Crosta](https://handsfree-japan.com/en/about/)** also offers airport luggage storage at Kansai International.

 - **[New Chitose Airport](http://www.new-chitose-airport.jp/en/service/baggage/baggage_checkroom/)** offers temporary baggage storage, although no storage time limit is specified on the airport's website. A large suitcase can stored for ¥820 per day.

**Yokohama City Air Terminal (Y-CAT)**, the city’s bus terminal, also offers a cloakroom service for ¥720 per item per day. The storage facility is located in lobby 2.

###How can I forward my luggage to the airport or to my next destination?

Several delivery companies offering luggage forwarding services operate throughout Japan, including: **[JALABC](https://www.jalabc.com/english/)**, **[Yamato Transport (Kuroneko)](http://www.kuronekoyamato.co.jp/en/tourist/hotel/)**, and **[Sagawa Express](http://www.sagawa-exp.co.jp/ttk/english/)**. In Kansai, **[Crosta](https://handsfree-japan.com/en/about/)** is a relatively new luggage forwarding service targeting tourists visiting Kyoto and Osaka. These services generally deliver luggage and other parcels to airports, hotels, residences and convenience stores — making them a convenient option for travelers who do not want to carry their bags while transiting throughout Japan. 

Items can be sent from baggage forwarding service stations located at airports, at locations of the forwarding service (ie: A Kuroneko Yamato office), in hotels or shopping malls, most convenience stores and supermarkets.

Travelers can specify the date and time for bags to arrive at their final destination up to 7 days after pick-up. Delivery is generally completed within one to two days, with an extra day required for remote areas like Hokkaido and Okinawa.

For general luggage forwarding, prices range from about ¥1000-¥5000 per item, depending on the size.

When sending bags from the airport, most travelers should be able to receive their luggage on the same day, depending on the area. When sending luggage **to** the airport however, it will need to do be done at least **2 to 3 days prior to departure**. For airport luggage forwarding, prices range from about ¥2000-¥4000 per item, depending on the size.

##Lodging and Accommodations

###Where should I stay? How much should I spend on lodging?

We have a comprehensive [lodging and accommodations faq](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/wiki/faqs/lodging) that you can check out.

###My AirBnb got cancelled for not having a registration number! What does this mean, and what do I do next?

We're sorry to hear about this! Please note that this change has been on the books for awhile in Japan, and was implemented to ensure that AirBnb was operating under the same legal guidelines as hotels, hostels, and other accommodations in the country. Therefore, if hosts did not receive their paperwork in time to function as a Minpaku under Japanese Law, the government required AirBnb to close the locations or face a large fine. The consequences for hosts are equally severe, ranging in fines up to $10,000 to jail time for running an unlicensed Minpaku.

Right now, AirBnb is sorting through the listings to confirm Hosts that have their paperwork completed, and are removing the listings of those who don't. Even if your booking is still off in the distance, you may receive a cancellation email and a refund from AirBnb as a result of this. You can still book with AirBnb after a cancellation, but you will need to change locations or Hosts due to those cancellations. **If you have any questions regarding this aspect, we recommend you contact AirBnb as they are the only authority on this.**

We also have some community sourced information in [**this thread**](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/8os3mv/minpaku_law_airbnb_and_you_information_on_the_new/), but please note that as time goes on and the changes are more widely enforced that the only real source of credible information will be AirBnb. We will insist that any questions regarding cancellations/bookings/rebooking go through them first. As more changes or concerns arise, we may post another Megathread, but please note for the time being that all AirBnb posts are currently being removed from this subreddit.

###My Host cancelled, but now they're asking me to book directly with them and pay in cash only. Another Host has asked me to sign a lease of some kind, but I'm only staying for a week! What gives?

**Both of these requests are illegal.** In the first case, booking under the table is a violation of AirBnb policies and a violation of Minpaku Law, especially if the Host has already had their listing removed for being non-compliant with the licensing request. If you book with a Host that requests you follow their guidelines and not AirBnb, you open yourself up to all sorts of problems. If anything happens during your booking, AirBnb will not refund you the money, and they cannot guarantee the Host any longer. You may come back from a day's excursion and find the booking has been shut down by the local police, with all your items removed. There have been raids on AirBnb lodgings before the law, and booking under the table with a Host now would be sheer folly. **Don't do it.**

Signing any kind of Lease Agreement in Japan may seem wise, given that you're renting from someone you don't know - but it merely covers the Host if something goes wrong. If you sign it, and it does not include a guarantee for return of items, full refund, or some kind of legal protection should the police get involved, you may be on the hook for more than you'd like. Rather than worry about the "What Ifs", make a booking with a hotel, hostel, ryokan, or other legal accommodation that already has all their details worked out. **Do not sign any Lease Agreements to book an AirBnb, and if your Host asks you to do so, report them to AirBnb as this is against their Terms Of Service.**

###My AirBnb host is asking for a copy of my passport! Why?

In June 2018, a new law regulating the lease or rental of *minpaku* (private residences rented out by their owners as short-term lodgings) went into effect. The terms of this law requires minpaku to operate under similar legal guidelines to that of hotels and other legal forms of temporary lodging. These rules include the requirement that identification of foreign visitors to Japan be obtains for security purposes. If you were to stay in a hotel in Japan, a similar request would be made.

For AirBnb and other minpaku services, the request for passport submission may be made through AirBnb, through a third party service (ie: Faminect) or via email. If you are uncomfortable with the manner in which your information is requested, please do not post in the sub and instead contact AirBnb directly.

If you are worried about sharing your identification with an AirBnb host, it is recommended you stay at a large hotel chain or another form of lodging where you are comfortable providing your identification.

###How can I do my laundry?

Please consult the [laundry](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/wiki/faqs/lodging#wiki_where_can_i_do_my_laundry.3F) section of our Lodging and Accommodations wiki page.

## Shopping

###Where can I buy souvenirs? How does Tax Free shopping work?

Please refer to our [comprehensive shopping faq](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/wiki/faqs/shopping) for information on tax-free shopping, where to purchase particular items (as well as suggested stores) and general budgeting information.

##Train Travel and JR Passes

###How can I find train routes, subway routes or bus routes?

There are many apps and websites to help decipher and plan public transportation routes throughout Japan. For English speakers and tourists, the most popular and most commonly used transit planner is **[Hyperdia](http://www.hyperdia.com/)**, which is both a website and an app for iOS and Android devices.

Hyperdia is free for 30 days for first time users and requires the purchase of a yearly or monthly licence after the trial period expires. For non-Japanese speakers, Hyperdia is most accurate and reliable transportation planner. Do not rely upon Google Maps for train schedules; it is often wrong, sends individuals on strange and inconvenient routes and misses many express trains. However, for planning out public bus routes, Google Maps is the only English-language option for mobile use.

Hyperdia will provide several routes based on desired departure or desired arrival times and will include information such as: Fare, seat fee (a cost that is in addition to ticket fare mostly used on long-distance trains), travel time, transfers and platform information (for selection stations).

If you can read and write in Japanese, both Navitime and Yahoo! Transit are extremely reliable and have more features than Hyperdia — including real-time delays. These apps also include bus services. Navitime has a limited function free version, while Yahoo! has a more robust free app.

Specific maps for local trains and shinkansen in Tokyo, Kyoto and Osaka can be found [here](https://www.jrailpass.com/maps) and this covers both JR and non-JR lines.

###How much are local (non-Shinkansen) train, subway or bus fares?

Most local train systems work on a distance-based fare system, where the cost of your trip depends on how far you travel. A single ride will usually cost you anywhere from ￥140-￥550 — although most tourists tend to travel shorter distances, making the average train ride cost on the lower end of that range. If you are planning on heavily utilizing trains for sightseeing, or if your lodging is further from main tourist areas, you should plan on taking at least 3-4 train rides per day.

Some common train routes and average fares for reference:

* Shinjuku to Akihabara (Tokyo) - ￥170  
* Shinjuku to Harajuku (Tokyo) - ￥140  
* Shibuya to Ueno (Tokyo) - ￥200  
* Shibuya to Maihama (Tokyo Disney) - ￥420  
* Tokyo Station to Yokohama (Tokyo) - ￥470  
* Osaka Station to Tennoji (Osaka) - ￥190  
* Kyoto Station to Osaka Station (non-Shinkansen) - ￥560  
* Hiroshima Station to Miyajimaguchi (Hiroshima) - ￥410  

To get a more accurate sense of how much you might spend on train fare, use [Hyperdia](http://www.hyperdia.com) to plot out train routes you plan on taking.

Local bus lines either use flat-rate or distance-based fares, with the type of fare varying between bus operators and between cities. For example, many of the major bus services operating within the 23 Wards of Tokyo use a fixed-fare system. A good rule of thumb to determine whether a bus utilizes distance fares or flat fares is to note how passengers board the bus. Buses where passengers board at the front of the bus and scan their IC card or pay immediately are generally flat-rate buses. Buses where passengers board from the middle or rear of the bus and but tap their IC card upon embarking and disembarking (or take a ticket upon embarking and pay when disembarking) usually charge based on distance.

Average bus fares range from ￥100-250 for flat-rate buses and ￥190-350 for distance-based buses. Many communities also offer free local buses or shuttles.

###How do I purchase (non-Shinkansen) train or subway tickets?

Most tickets for local train and subway systems are purchased via automated ticketing machines located in nearly every station outside of the ticket gates. [JR's official website](http://www.jreast.co.jp/e/ticket/purchase.html) has a handy English guide and video that explains the ticket purchasing process utilizing JR ticketing machines. 

Train fares are calculated by distance traveled. Travelers purchasing individual tickets and not using an IC card will have to use the fare map located above or near the ticketing machines at their starting station to determine the cost of train fare. This is done by locating the intended arrival station on the map and noting the fare associated with that stop. Transferring between rail lines requires buying individual tickets for each line utilized (ie: JR to Keio). It is important to note that most stations only offer this fare map in Japanese — so travelers without Japanese language skills may find the individual ticket purchasing process to be difficult.

Because of the difficulty in calculating individual ticket costs, especially when travel involves transferring between rail lines, most Japanese residents and tourists opt to use a rechargeable **IC card** when utilizing public transportation. The IC card automatically calculates the fare traveled and deducts that fare from the card's stored balance. Cards can be "topped up" at any ticket machine bearing the universal [IC card logo](http://puu.sh/oMNkv/1e90151375.jpg). Utilizing an IC card also offers a slight discount (~￥5) on train fare versus purchasing an individual ticket. 

###What is an IC Card/Suica/PASMO etc.?

An IC card is a rechargeable transit fare card (also known as a contactless smart card) that can be used to pay for public transit (trains, most buses) across Japan. These cards are similar to other transit cards used worldwide, such as the Oyster Card in London, the TAP Card in Los Angeles, or the OV-Chipkaart in the Netherlands. IC cards can be purchased at automatic ticket machines and ticket counters at nearly every station across the country. IC cards do not cover travel on the Shinkansen, highway buses, or airport buses.

The IC card automatically calculates the fare traveled and deducts that fare from the card's stored balance. Cards can be "topped up" at any ticket machine bearing the universal [IC card logo](http://puu.sh/oMNkv/1e90151375.jpg). Utilizing an IC card also offers a slight discount (~￥5) on train fare versus purchasing an individual ticket. 

IC Cards can also be used at vending machines, some stores, and some restaurants; generally, wherever the universal [IC card logo](http://puu.sh/oMNkv/1e90151375.jpg) is displayed, IC cards are accepted for payment. 

When arriving in Japan, the IC card you receive depends on where you first obtain the IC card. For many tourists, this can either be a Suica or PASMO (when landing in Tokyo) or an ICOCA (when landing in Kansai).

Note that you can only return a card in the region where you purchased it. If you land in Osaka, pick up an ICOCA, then travel to Tokyo and leave from there, you won't be able to return your ICOCA. Many people choose to keep their IC Cards as a souvenir or for future trips to Japan.

For the most part, the 10 major IC Cards are compatible with each other and can be used on almost all rail systems. (Certain IC cards, such as the Traffica Kyoto Card or Surutto Kansai Miyako Card, are not compatible with other rail/transport systems.) However, the most commonly obtained cards described below are cross-compatible, meaning very few tourists will run into issues using one of the following cards during their trip, no matter which cities they visit.

**COMPATIBLE IC CARDS:**

* [Suica](http://www.jreast.co.jp/e/pass/suica.html), issued by JR East in the Greater Tokyo, Niigata and Sendai regions. **NOTE**: The Suica card cannot be used in stores from the Pitapa network
* [PASMO](https://www.pasmo.co.jp/en/about/), issued by Tokyo Metro, as well as rail and bus companies not operated by JR in the Tokyo region
* [ICOCA](https://www.westjr.co.jp/global/en/howto/guide/movie03.html), issued by JR West in Greater Osaka, Okayama and Hiroshima regions. This is the only card that works on non-JR transportation in Okayama and Hiroshima
* [Toica](http://www.japan-guide.com/g8/2359_toica.gif), issued by JR Central in the Greater Nagoya area and some parts of Shizuoka Prefecture
* [Manaca](http://www.japan-guide.com/g8/2359_manaca.gif), issued by Nagoya subway, rail and bus companies not operated by JR and Kintetsu Railway
* [Kitaca](http://www.japan-guide.com/g8/2359_kitaca.gif), issued by JR Hokkaido in the Greater Sapporo region
* [Sugoca](http://www.japan-guide.com/g8/2359_sugoca.gif), issued by JR Kyushu in the Greater Fukuoka, Kumamoto, Kagoshima, Oita and Nagasaki regions
* [Nimoca](http://www.japan-guide.com/g8/2359_nimoca.gif), issued by Nishitetsu (AKA: Nishi-Nippon Railroad) trains and buses in Greater Fukuoka, as well other cities in the Kyushu region
* [Hayakaken](http://www.japan-guide.com/g8/2359_hayakaken.gif), issued by Fukuoka City Subway

[Pitapa](http://www.japan-guide.com/g8/2359_pitapa.gif) is a postpaid card and is not available to tourists; it is very unlikely you will come across this card. However, it is also compatible with the aforementioned IC card services.

[Additional information on IC cards is available via Japan Guide](http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2359_003.html).

###I'm going to Tokyo. Should I get a Suica or a PASMO?

In Tokyo, the pass you receive depends on the ticket machine from which you purchase your IC Card. JR ticket terminals sell Suica cards, while non-JR terminals (ie: Tokyo Metro, Keio, etc.) dispense PASMO cards. The only difference between Suica and PASMO is in name and appearance. One is not "better" than the other.

###How do I add money to my IC Card/Suica/PASMO etc.?

When utilizing the English language setting on a ticket machine, recharging an IC Card is fairly straightforward. Simply insert your IC Card into the proper slot on the machine, select the amount to be charged, insert the cash and retrieve your IC Card. All ticket machines will offer change in both bill and coin form if you insert more money than you would like to charge. (ie: If you only select ￥2000 to be added to your IC Card and insert a ￥10,000 bill, the machine will give you ￥8000 in change.) Some machines require the user to touch a "charge" confirmation button once money has been added to the machine.

[This guide from PASMO](https://www.pasmo.co.jp/en/use/charge/) details the process of recharging an IC Card using a PASMO machine step by step. This process is very similar across all major IC card machines. Videos on how to use other machines (ie: Suica, ICOCA) can be found online — however, the process is extremely simple and is best figured out in person. You might be surprised how easy using an IC card can be once you arrive in Japan!

If an IC card does not have enough balance to pay for a fare, passengers can add money to the card in the same manner by using a designated fare adjustment machine, which is usually located by each train station exit inside the ticket gates. Stations or exits without a fare adjustment machine require paying in person to the attendant manning the ticket gate. This is done by simply presenting your card to the attendant and paying the raiming balance in cash.

###Can I use a credit card to recharge my IC Card?

No. Unless you are a resident of Japan and are utilizing the Suica + Apple Pay program, IC Cards can only be charged with cash at an IC compatible ticket machine. 

###I need to transfer between lines to get to my destination. Will my IC card cover this ride?

Yes, assuming you have a balance on your IC card that covers the fare. If you do not have enough money on your card, you will need to add money to the card by using a ticket machine or fare adjustment machine. See [How do I add money to my IC Card/Suica/PASMO etc.?](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/wiki/faqs/japantravel#wiki_how_do_i_add_money_to_my_ic_card.2Fsuica.2Fpasmo_etc..3F) for more information.

###I'm going to Tokyo. Do I need a train pass?

A variety of day passes are available for the Tokyo area. However, most are overpriced and/or not practical for a majority of tourists — primarily because the passes do not cover all train or subway lines, or because tourists do not make enough train rides per day to justify the overall cost of the pass. Purchasing single tickets or utilizing an IC card, especially if you plan your city sightseeing in a geographically efficient manner, is usually the most cost-effective way to travel around Tokyo.

(For example, many users on /r/JapanTravel often ask whether or not the Tokyo Metro 3 day passes are an efficient transit option. If your lodging is serviced by a Tokyo Metro station and you do not mind walking between locations not serviced by JR, then this might be beneficial. However, utilizing JR trains can often reduce a 30 minute Metro ride into a 5 minute JR train ride, or might reduce walking long distances between locations. Every travel situation is different — so it's important you plan out your itinerary and know where your lodging is prior to deciding whether or not to purchase any type of transit pass for tourists.)

It's very hard to make a JR Pass worth it during a visit that only encompasses Tokyo and/or nearby areas like Hakone, Kamakura or Nikko. For Tokyo area travel, it would take about 150+ trips on the Yamanote line in a week to equal the cost of a 7 day JR Pass. For Tokyo trips that include nearby areas, local passes, such as the Hakone Free Pass, are usually a more affordable, cost-efficient option.

To see a list of day passes and for more information on transit within Tokyo, please [read Japan Guide's Tokyo transit page](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2017.html).

### What is the JR Pass and how do I use it? 

For information on the JR Pass — including its validity, where to purchases it, the difference between Green and Ordinary cars, and how to determine if a JR Pass is economical for you itinerary — please visit our designated **[JR Pass Information Page](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/wiki/advice/transport/jrpass)**.

###How do I purchase Shinkansen tickets?

If you do not have a [JR Pass](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/wiki/advice/transport/jrpass) and wish to ride the shinkansen, you will need to buy individual tickets either before or during your stay in Japan.

Shinkansen tickets can be purchased at any JR Ticket Office (Midori-no-guchi) or JR Travel Service Centers. You do not need to buy the ticket at the station you intend to depart from. (Example: A traveler staying in Shibuya can purchase a shinkansen ticket departing from Tokyo Station at the Shibuya JR Ticket Office.) Credit cards can be used at JR East Ticket Offices and Travel Service Centers. Shinkansen tickets can also be purchased at select ticket machines, but English support is not always guaranteed. Travelers who are not confident in navigating a Japanese menu should purchase tickets at a JR Ticketing or Travel counter.

Shinkansen tickets can also be [purchased online through JR's website](https://www.jreast.co.jp/e/ticket/reservation.html). Unless you are planning to take the shinkansen during Golden Week, New Year's holidays or Obon, most trains will have ample space available on the day of departure; pre-purchasing before arriving in Japan won't be necessary. Simply purchase your tickets from any ticket office while in Japan at least 1-2 hours before your desired departure time.

To calculate how much your shinkansen ticket will cost, you can either use [Hyperdia](http://hyperdia.com) or the [JR Ticketing website](https://www.jreast.co.jp/e/ticket/reservation.html). A shinkansen ticket is made up of several fees:

 - **Base fare**: The fare to be paid to get from A to B. Increases step wise according to the distance traveled. Issued as a base fare ticket (乗車券).

 - **Shinkansen supplement (limited express fee)**: The supplement fee to be paid for using a shinkansen train (as opposed to a local train). The fee increases step wise according to the distance traveled. The express supplement is issued as a limited express fee ticket (特急券).

 - **Seat reservation fee**: ￥320/￥520/￥720 depending on whether it is low season, regular season or high season. An additional supplement (￥100-620 depending on distance traveled) applies for using reserved seats on Nozomi, Mizuho, Hayabusa and Komachi trains. The seat reservation fee is usually combined with the express supplement into a single ticket.

 - **Green car fee**: The supplement fee for riding the green car. Increases step wise according to the distance traveled. It is usually combined with the express supplement into a single ticket.

A passenger typically receives two pieces of tickets (a base fare ticket and a supplement ticket), although in some situations the two tickets are combined into a single ticket. If multiple trains are involved, there can be more than two tickets (one supplement ticket for each train).

###How crowded will the Shinkansen be during my trip?

If you are visiting Japan during peak domestic travel seasons (ie: Golden Week, New Years) expect Shinkansen (and most other long-distance transportation) to be at capacity. Reserving seats in advance is highly recommended.

For all other times of year, you can [use online crowd forecasters](http://www.jr.cyberstation.ne.jp/vacancy/Vacancy.html) to get a general idea of how full or empty a particular train on a particular route may be. These numbers are only an estimate based on previous train use and should not be taken as 100% fact.

##Dining in Japan

### Where can I research places to eat in Japan?

There are many websites one can utilize in order to search for places to dine in Japan:

These websites allow users to search by area, type of establishment, budget and type of cuisine. Information including opening hours, closure dates and maps to the restaurant are usually also included. Many of the sites include reviews from diners.

Conducting a Google search based upon a type of food or location (ie: "best burgers Tokyo", "tonkotsu ramen Shinjuku," "must eat Osaka") will also provide a wealth of information that you can use to plan your dining excursions. Websites such as Time Out Tokyo and personal blogs generally have plenty of English information on restaurants in Japan.

For Japanese websites that have the option to be read in English, please note that not all entries or information available on the Japanese websites will be translated or included.

###How can I explain I have a food allergy or a dietary restriction?

Travelers with food allergies will have a slightly easier time navigating Japan's vast selection of cuisine, thanks primarily to an increased awareness of allergies and a fairly recent law passed in September 2013 that requires all packaged food to contain an allergen list or full ingredient list. It is important to note, however, that this law does not apply to restaurants and only covers packaged foods.

Travelers who practice a specific diet such as veganism, Halal or Kosher will have a slightly more difficult time dining out in Japan, depending on the restrictiveness of their eating habits. If you are friendly and courteous, restaurant staff will try to meet your dietary needs as best as possible. However, it is also possible that not every restaurant will be able to accommodate you based upon your food requests. Unlike Western countries, Japanese restaurants do not make complex modifications to dishes and, in many cases, will refuse to do so. 

Travelers with food aversions (also known as "picky eating") will have a similarly difficult time in Japan for many of the same reasons as those with restrictive diets. As mentioned above, Japanese restaurants do not make complex modifications to dishes and may completely refuse to do so. It is important that you read or translate menus thoroughly and ask for assistance if there is a specific type of food or ingredient you do not eat.

For a more thorough look into dining in Japan with food allergies or a restrictive diet, please refer to the **[Food aversions, allergies and specific diets](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/wiki/advice#wiki_food_aversions.2C_allergies_and_specific_diets)** section of the General Advice page, which includes helpful links and a full explanation of Japan's food allergen law. You may also search the subreddit for [past topics on food allergies](https://www.google.com/webhp?hl=en#hl=en&q=site:reddit.com%2Fr%2FjapanTravel+allergy).

### How do I book reservations for a high-end or exclusive restaurant in Japan?

Many restaurants, especially high-end dining establishments or restaurants with Michelin stars, will require reservations. You have a few options for booking reservations at one of these establishments:

* Checking the restaurant's website for online, email, or phone reservation options. Some places will have easy-to-use systems (even for foreigners) or will speak some English on the phone
* Asking your hotel concierge or AirBnB host to help you book reservations. Hotel and hosts will often do this if the restaurant doesn't require a deposit. If the restaurants requires a deposit, they will usually be reluctant to assume responsibility
* Utilizing a credit card concierge (like Amex Platinum or Chase Sapphire Reserve) to make reservations. This usually requires calling or emailing your credit card company to place a request, and can be hit or miss for reservations in Japan
* Using a paid service like [Voyagin](https://www.govoyagin.com/destinations/japan) to book for you. Services like these tend to be very reliable and helpful, but are sometimes quite expensive, generally charging a certain amount per person on the reservation as a non-refundable booking fee. This can be a good hassle-free option for individuals without a hotel or credit card concierge service at their disposal, but comes at an extra cost

Please note that you should always show up for a reservation you make at a high-end restaurant. No-shows and excessive cancellations by tourists and foreigners in Japan have led many restaurants to implement a "no regulars" or "no tourist" rule for their establishments. If you don't think you can guarantee to show up for a reserved time slot at a restaurant, then **do not** make the reservation.

##Museums, Cultural Activities and Other Attractions

###What are goshuin and how do I receive them?

[Please read the comprehensive guide to goshuin](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/6wyt0z/guide_temple_and_shrine_stamps_aka_what_are/) written by moderator /u/HimeKat.

###Festivals and Events

Festivals and events occur year-round in Japan. The dates for many of these events change yearly — so it is best to check with reliable sources on the Internet to confirm what may be happening during your trip. The best way to do this is to Google [name of city or town] + events [year you are traveling].

Many websites maintain lists of events, but the majority are city or prefecture-specific. [Japan Cheapo](https://japancheapo.com/events/) has a very basic nationwide event calendar. 

For Tokyo, [Tokyo Cheapo](https://tokyocheapo.com/events/), [Time Out Tokyo](https://www.timeout.com/tokyo) and [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Festivals_in_Tokyo) are good places to begin your research.

For Kyoto, [Inside Kyoto](https://www.insidekyoto.com/kyoto-festivals-events) and the [Kyoto city official travel guide](https://kyoto.travel/en/planyourvisit/events) are two reliable sources.

###Studio Ghibli Museum

The [Ghibli Museum](http://www.ghibli-museum.jp/) is a museum showcasing the work of the Japanese animation studio Studio Ghibli. It is located in Inokashira Park, a large sprawling park located in the Tokyo suburbs of Kichijoji and Mitaka that is also home to the Inokashira Zoo, food vendors, children's entertainers on weekends, a large lake with rental boats and other attractions.

The museum requires that all tickets be purchased in advanced. **Tickets cannot be purchased at the Ghibli Museum**.

The Ghibli Museum is easily accessible by train. Travelers coming from the Shibuya area or transiting through Shibuya Station should take the Keio Inokashira line to Kichijoji Station. The museum is a 10-15 minute walk through Inokashira Park from Kichijoji. Travelers coming from or transiting through Shinjuku should take the JR Chuo Line to either Kichijoji or Mitaka Stations. Kichijoji is one stop before Mitaka, so visitors who would like to walk through Inokashira Park should stop at Kichijoji. The museum is a 15 minute walk from Mitaka Station and the walk is not as scenic as the Kichijoji walk. Therefore, unless you are planning on taking the museum bus, visitors should exit at Kichijoji Station for museum access. There are many Ghibli-themed signs in Inokashira Park to direct visitors to the museum.

Visitors with mobility issues may want to consider taking the designated bus from Mitaka station that goes directly to the museum. [Bus schedules](http://www.ghibli-museum.jp/en/howtogo/) can be found on the museum's website. Adult fares are ¥‎210 for a one-way trip, or ¥‎320 for a round trip. Fares for children 12 and under are ¥‎110 for a one-way trip or ¥‎160 for a round trip.

####How do I book tickets for the Ghibli Museum?

The Ghibli Museum website has a page in English that details the [entire ticket purchasing process](http://www.ghibli-museum.jp/en/ticket-information/).

Once in Japan, travelers can also purchase tickets via the Loppi ticket machine at any Lawson's convenience store. Please note that tickets might not be available for purchase, as the museum's tickets often sell out upon being released for general sale. For more information, please read the [English guide to Lawson kiosk ticket machines](http://www.lawson.co.jp/ghibli/museum/ticket/detail/english.html).

Travelers can also buy tickets from a proxy or resale service such as Govoyagin or Viator. These services will add a significant markup to the overall cost of the tickets, so expect to pay anywhere from 2x to 4x the price of a ticket.

###Sumo Wrestling

The most popular sumo events in Japan are sumo tournaments, which are held six times a year throughout the country and last for 15 days. For those visiting Japan between sumo tournaments, there are a few other ways to see sumo — including exhibition tournaments and retirement ceremonies of prominent wrestlers.

The [official Nihon Sumo Kyokai website](http://www.sumo.or.jp/En/) contains information and schedules for all sumo-related events, including non-tournament events.

Sumo stables, where the wrestlers live and train, are neither public places nor sightseeing spots. Only a small number of stables accept visits by tourists — and these stables require visitors be accompanied by a person who is fluent in Japanese and closely familiar with the customs of the sumo world. Various organizations and companies offer such tours and typically charge around ￥10,000 for a sumo stable visit. Visitors are expected to follow the house rules and not disturb the training session. Expect to sit silently on the floor for two to three hours. It is virtually impossible for foreign tourist to visit a stable on their own.

####How do I book tickets for a sumo tournament?

Sumo tournaments are extremely popular events that regularly sell out, with many tournaments selling out in a few hours. The [official tournament schedule](http://www.sumo.or.jp/EnTicket/year_schedule) is usually posted several years in advance for planning purposes. As of 2017, the schedule is available through 2020. Tournaments are regularly held in Tokyo, Osaka, Aichi and Fukuoka.

Tickets are sold via [the official sumo website](http://www.sumo.or.jp/En/) about one month before each tournament. Hopeful ticket buyers can enter a lottery, usually held about six weeks before general ticket sales, to increase their chances of obtaining a seat to the tournament on their preferred date. While the official sumo website does accept foreign credit cards, purchasers will need a Japanese address where the tickets can be sent (~1 week to arrive after purchase) **or** must pick up the tickets from a convenience store within one week of purchase. Those who are unable to receive tickets in Japan can utilize a ticket broker service specializing in procuring sumo tickets for overseas buyers.

Tickets range in price from ￥3800 for a single seat to ￥35,000+ per person for ringside seats. On the day of each match, a select number of tickets may be available for purchase at the sumo venue. Competition for these tickets is fierce, so plan on showing up early to increase your chances.

###Mt. Fuji

**The official climbing season for Mt. Fuji is open from July to mid September.** During this period the mountain is usually free of snow, access by public transportation is plentiful, and the mountain huts are operating. The mountain is, as expected, crowded during this time, with the highest concentration of hikers appearing during Obon and during school holidays in late July. There are four trails visitors can use to climb the mountain, each with varying levels of difficulty and popularity among hikers. 

For more information about the climb — including how to access Fuji during the climbing season, how to reserve mountain huts and general climbing tips — an in-depth article [can be found on Japan Guide](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e6901.html). 

Transportation to the Fuji area and services on the mountain are greatly reduced outside of the climbing season. Climbing outside of the designated climbing season **is not recommended** due to high winds, risk of avalanche and dangerous weather conditions. Even extremely skilled climbers die each year while attempting to climb Fuji outside of the official climbing season. **Please note that posts made here attempting to glean information on how to do it, or garner justification to climb out of the off-season will be removed, once we've had a chance to scold you heavily for it. We will not ever encourage anyone to do so, nor will we allow posts that look like we support it.**

For those not climbing Fuji or visiting outside climbing season, Fuji can sometimes be seen from nearby areas. Visibility varies greatly depending on weather conditions and is unpredictable. Please understand that you may not be able to see Fuji during your visit to the Mt. Fuji area.  To increase your chances of success, try to see the mountain in the early mornings or late afternoons — especially during the colder winter months when visibility tends to better than during summer. The mountain's famous snow cap is typically visible from around November to around May.

The Fuji Five Lakes region on the northern slopes of Mount Fuji offers visitors the highest chance for good views of the mountain due to its proximity. The more distant Hakone is also a popular place to see the mountain, but odds of catching clear views are lower there since it needs to be clear both in Hakone and around the mountain.

####I'm looking to climb Fuji during the season, where do I find more information regarding buses, trails and schedules?

[Japan Guide](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e6901.html) is a great, easy to read, resource to plan transportation to Mt. Fuji, as the bus timetables are broken down by down by trailhead, time and season. You can find specific information for each trailhead [here](https://www.japan-guide.com/bus/fuji_season.html) along with links to the website for bus bookings, plus information regarding costs in yen and whether or not it's covered by the JR Pass. Not all trail-heads have buses that can be booked in advance, and you may need to switch trails if you are climbing on a specific, or restricted schedule.

####I'd like to climb, but I'm worried about going alone. Can I book a group climb with a local guide?

You sure can! Some websites that offer guided packages are [JAPANiCAN](https://www.japanican.com/en/special/tours/mt_fuji/index.aspx), [Willer Express](http://willerexpress.com/en/fuji/tokyo/?mid=157&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIxs-WntPv2wIVBZJ-Ch3ePQcLEAAYASAAEgLoX_D_BwE), and [Yokoso Japan Tour](https://www.yokosojapan-tour.com/en/tours/25340-2340?waad=Q313WWjV&ugad=Q313WWjV). These links are provided for your perusal and reference, so do your research as to whether or not they are right for you.



###Yayoi Kusama Museum

The [Yayoi Kusama Museum](http://yayoikusamamuseum.jp/) is an art museum in the Shinjuku ward of Tokyo founded by the avant-garde artist Yayoi Kusama. It opened in October 2017 with the aim of spreading and promoting Kusama’s art, exhibiting her works and related materials to contribute to the development of art as a whole. 

The museum requires that all tickets be purchased in advanced. **Tickets cannot be purchased at the Yayoi Kusama Museum**.

####How do I book tickets for the Yayoi Kusama Museum?

The Yayoi Kusama Museum website has a page in English that details the [entire ticket purchasing process](http://www.e-tix.jp/yayoikusamamuseum/en/). Tickets go on-sale two months in advance on the first of every month at 10 a.m. JST time. Tickets may be purchased by foreigners using foreign credit cards, and the museum offers a "print at home" option for these individuals.

###Live Music and Concerts

####I want to buy tickets to [xyz] concert in Japan! How can I do this?

Large scale concerts in Japan, such as arena tours and J-Pop concerts, require tickets to be purchased in advance via several pre-sale tiers. Many artists will allow fan club members to purchase tickets before general ticket sales open to the public. Before general sales, a lottery period may also be  held for the public to allow individuals to receive a chance at buying tickets before a wider release. These lotteries require advance reservations and almost always are limited to individuals already residing in Japan, as payment must be made within several days of the lottery results being posting. Lotteries can be held through ticket providers (ie: E+, Ticket Pia) or through the artists' fan club or website.

A select number of artists allow overseas buyers to purchase tickets online for shows held in Japan. This generally is only done by famous foreign artists (ie: Coldplay) or by artists/events popular with foreign tourists (ie: Anime orchestral shows).

If no overseas purchasing option is available for the show you wish to see, you have two options: Using a ticket proxy service or waiting until you arrive in Japan to purchase tickets at a convenience store. Depending on the artist, the latter option might not be available to you, as many shows sell-out in the general public on-sale periods. Proxy services are heavily advertised online and can be found by conducting a Google search.

For small shows (ie: not arena concerts, local bands), you can generally buy tickets at the door.

Most non-arena shows in Japan have a mandatory drink charge of ￥500, which is paid at the door. This is in addition to the admission fee and can be used for both non-alcoholic or alcoholic beverages.

####Where can I find show listings or venues for [xyz] style of music in Japan?

The easiest way to learn about concerts and live music in Japan is, naturally, by Googling and looking at event calendars for a particular city or region. This will allow you to become familiar with the names of popular music venues — and almost all music venues have a website where more thorough concert listings are posted. For example, if you see on Japan Times several concerts being held at Shibuya O-Nest similar to music you enjoy, you can go to Shibuya O-Nest's website and peruse their full calendar to see if anything interests you.

Some useful resources for finding live music listings in Japan:

* [Tokyo Gig Guide](https://www.tokyogigguide.com/en/)
* [Time Out Tokyo](https://www.timeout.com/tokyo/music)
* [The Japan Times - Music Guide](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/events/categories/music-guide/)
* [Resident Advisor](https://www.residentadvisor.net/events/jp/tokyo)
* [Kansai Finder](https://kansaifinder.com/events/)
* [Kaala](https://www.kaala.jp/)

####What time should I show up for a concert?

Start times for shows are prompt and exact in Japan. A 7pm start time means the show will start at 7pm sharp. Shows are almost always finished before last trains, generally somewhere between 10-11:30pm.

Shows for large idol group or arena shows often require arriving at the venue several hours before doors open.

###Onsen

####I am afraid of being naked in front of strangers! Can I wear a bathing suit in an onsen?

Generally speaking, no. With the exception of onsen resorts targeted to families with young children, the majority of onsen in Japan do not allow clothing or bathing suits to be worn in the onsen waters for hygienic reasons. At onsen with mixed-gender baths (baths in which men and women share the same facilities), women **may** be allowed to use a facility-provided towel to cover their breasts or genitals. (Personal towels cannot be used, again for hygienic reasons.) However, many mixed-gender onsen do not offer this service.

Due to changing social norms surrounding mixed-gender nudity, the majority of onsen in Japan are separated by gender. This means that, in public facilities, you will only use changing rooms, bathing facilities and baths with individuals of the same gender as you. However, if you are still nervous about being nude in front of others regardless of gender, there are still some options available to you.

Some onsen resorts or day onsens offer a private bath, sometimes referred to as a "family bath," for reserved use. Occasionally, family baths are offered free of charge to guests of a ryokan or hotel — but the vast majority of these private onsen facilities require a small fee, ranging anywhere from ￥500-4000 for a reservation. Reservation lengths vary b y facility, but most are 45 minutes to 60 minutes in length. Additionally, most facilities only allow guests to reserve these baths upon arrival at the onsen, hotel or ryokan. Please inquire with the facility you wish to visit to confirm their policies. (Onsen rules and availability are almost always available on a facility's website.)

If you will be staying at a ryokan or hotel with onsen facilities, your lodging might offer in-room baths in certain rooms. These are generally very easy to spot when making hotel or ryokan reservations. Not all facilities offer in-room baths, and the cost for these rooms is significantly more expensive than rooms without a bath.

####I am transgender/gender non-conforming. Can I use an onsen?

Individuals who do not identify as their birth-assigned sex must take great care in using onsen facilities. Transgenderism is treated as a very taboo subject in Japan, and the prevalence of transgendered individuals is very low. Similarly, public understanding of gender non-conforming individuals is not as widespread as it may be in Western countries. As a result, transgender individuals run the risk of being arrested, assaulted or otherwise placed in harm's way if they were to visit an onsen without taken proper steps to ensure their presence would not disturb others.

If you are transgender and have not had top/bottom surgery (ie: present as male, but retain female genitalia; present as female, but retain male genitalia) you should, **under no circumstances** use a public bath, mixed gender or gender separated. Your appeance will be the source of a lot of confusion, and other patrons might be made extremely uncomfortable by your presence. For these individuals, visiting an onsen, ryokan or hotel with private family baths or in-room onsen is the best (and, frankly, only) way to partake in onsen use.

If you are gender non-conforming (ie: dress androgynously, but have had no surgery to alter your physical appearance), **please** use the onsen that corresponds with the sex you were assigned at birth. If the thought of using a gendered facility or being around individuals of one gender is psychologically/emotionally distressing for you, then it is best to follow the guidelines given above and to only utilize private or in-room baths. 

##Traveling In Japan - Special Considerations.

###I'm traveling to Japan and I identify as LGBTQIA+, what should I expect?

**What to reasonably expect when traveling:** By and large, unless you are aggressively open about your sexual preference, most people will not notice or pay mind to the fact that you are gay. The only situation where it may become of note is if you are traveling with your partner, and you engage in any public displays of affection (kissing/hand holding). This is generally frowned upon in Japanese society for deep rooted cultural reasons, some of which are covered at World Nomad's site, titled [Queer Travel In Japan](https://www.worldnomads.com/travel-safety/eastern-asia/japan/queer-travel-in-japan). Please also take a peek at [Stonewall Japan's page](http://stonewalljapan.org/) for further information in english, as well as their [Facebook page.](https://www.facebook.com/stonewalljapan/)

**What to reasonably expect when traveling as a transgendered individual:** Japan is still quite old-fashioned, and while you may not have anyone confront you specifically, stares and comments from locals may still happen. If you do not speak Japanese, you may not interpret the comments in public and thus they may not affect you. Washroom use should be for whichever washroom you visibly confirm to, as quite a lot of them are fully private stalls with closing doors. Some genderless washrooms are popping up more and more as well, to add another layer of acceptance to slowly changing Japanese society. As noted in the "Onsen" section, however, care should be taken as transgendered individuals are not as prevalent in society and treated as very taboo overall. Take to heart that the advice suggested in that section is intended to give you the best possible experience within a strongly traditional country.

**When using Onsen:** Individuals who do not identify as their birth-assigned sex must take great care in using onsen facilities. Transgenderism is treated as a very taboo subject in Japan, and the prevalence of transgendered individuals is very low. Similarly, public understanding of gender non-conforming individuals is not as widespread as it may be in Western countries. As a result, transgender individuals run the risk of being arrested, assaulted or otherwise placed in harm's way if they were to visit an onsen without taken proper steps to ensure their presence would not disturb others. If you are transgender and have not had top/bottom surgery (ie: present as male, but retain female genitalia; present as female, but retain male genitalia) you should, under no circumstances use a public bath, mixed gender or gender separated. Your appearance will be the source of a lot of confusion, and other patrons might be made extremely uncomfortable by your presence. For these individuals, visiting an onsen, ryokan or hotel with private family baths or in-room onsen is the best (and, frankly, only) way to partake in onsen use.

**If you are gender non-conforming (ie: dress androgynously, but have had no surgery to alter your physical appearance)**, please use the onsen that corresponds with the sex you were assigned at birth. If the thought of using a gendered facility or being around individuals of one gender is psychologically/emotionally distressing for you, then it is best to follow the guidelines given above and to only utilize private or in-room baths.

**LGBTQIA+ Bars:** – **Shinjuku Ni-chome** is known to have some LGBTQ+ friendly/specific bars and clubs, but not all bars are accepting of foreigners. Some locations that are open to foreigners (and recommended by our sub) include **Dragon**, **Arty Farty**, **Aiiro**, **Annex** (which is a sister bar to Aiiro - apparently paying cover at one will gain you entrance to the other!), and **Advocates Cafe**. Remember that *if you are denied entry to a club it is not discrimination, private clubs are not uncommon in Japan and are generally restricted to locals who frequent the area*. The above noted page at World Nomad has some links that may be of interest to you, especially **OutAsia Travel**, as they can book tours of Ni-chome involving the bars that are LGBTQIA+ friendly. **Osaka** also has **Frenzy**, which is noted as a good place to go to find out more about the scene in general. The owner also speaks english!

**When booking Hostels/Hotels:** Staying in a hotel as a gay couple will probably fly under the radar. Pairs of same-sex individuals booking rooms in hotels or hostels in Japan are not uncommon, so it's highly unlikely that anyone will ask. Most places charge by the amount of people staying in a room, so if you indicate two people will be there, you may end up with two beds. If this is a concern for you as a couple, you may want to pay attention to the size of the bed, as a double may not comfortably fit two people. Airbnb can also be an option, but please confirm with your hosts that they will be abiding by the new Minpaku Law before you book.

###I'm traveling to Japan, and I am overweight/obese. What should I expect?

**What to reasonably expect for day-to-day travel:** Walking is one of the primary modes of transport in Japan, even with a well integrated train system, and especially in places like Kyoto. Another thing to think about is the time of year that you will be traveling as June – Late September and even early October can be very hot and humid. If you do not handle the heat and humidity well, you will need to change your itinerary to include frequently breaks for resting and rehydration. If you cannot handle stairs or inclines very well, you will want to avoid certain temples and other attractions. Taxis can be used as another form of transport, but they are generally quite expensive to rely on as a ride from place to place, and not all taxis are going to be able to get you to the entry point of your location.

**When using Onsen:** If you are self-concious about your size, you may prefer booking a private onsen at a ryokan instead of trying a public sento. You probably won’t be openly laughed at (sumo wrestlers are a thing, remember?), but you may get some commentary on your size. Unless you speak fluent Japanese, it's unlikely you'll know for a fact what is being said if anything.

**When booking Hostels/Hotels/Airbnb:** Staying in high end hotels may be your only option if you have limited mobility due to obesity. A hotel is going to have elevators to take you between floors easily, and will have staff to help manage your bags if you are unable to carry them yourself. While some hostels may have elevators it’s not a guarantee that your booking will unless it is clearly stated by the website you book through. Some hostels are also situated farther away from train stations, and in older buildings that may only have narrow stairs and no assistance for carrying luggage. Airbnb's will have no assistance, and you will be working with furniture that is suited for people that are smaller in size. Please review your planned accommodations carefully before booking to avoid having to cancel if you cannot easily get around under your own power.

**When taking trains and using train stations:** If you have concerns about taking transit with others because of your size, try to avoid the trains and buses during rush hour, especially if you find yourself needing a place to sit when the train or bus is in motion. Seat sizes are also generally smaller than you may be used to on both buses and trains. Elevators and escalators are not always conveniently located to train doors, and may require some walking to locate. Along with the sheer size of some train stations, this can make for more walking than anticipated. If you require special assistance to exit the building, you will need to alert the staff so they can assist you.

**Walkers/Canes/Wheelchairs/Accessibility Scooters:** **COMING SOON.**

**Some examples of locations that may be physically taxing/are not wheelchair friendly:** **Himeji Castle** has incredibly narrow stairs to the top of the castle, not to mention a lot of uneven stairs to gain access to the building. It still makes for a beautiful photo, but be aware that if you have easily tired legs, or you are not steady on your feet, you might do better to skip the castle itself and visit the nearby Gardens instead. Kyoto can be done via bus, but a lot of the bigger attractions like **Kiyomizudera**, **Fushimi Inari**, **Ginkaku-ji**, **Ryoan-ji**, **Arashiyama**, and **Nara** are reliant on you walking to the main parts of the buildings, and some of those locations have very narrow streets or a lot of stairs that need to be navigated. The buses don't always bring you right to the entrance of the location as well, so some walking is absolutely necessary. **Osaka Castle** is a reconstruction with an elevator, but the lines are generally long to get on, and you may be required to use the stairs to exit the building. If you are looking to use a wheelchair at any of these locations, you need to carefully research how many of them have stairs that need to be bypassed, and whether or not there is a seperate entry for persons in wheelchairs.
