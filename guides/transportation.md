## JR Pass

The **[Japan Rail Pass](http://www.japanrailpass.net/en/)** (commonly referred to as the JR Pass) is a cost-effective rail pass for long distance train travel in Japan. The JR Pass offers unlimited use of JR trains throughout Japan for one, two or three weeks at a highly reduced rate compared to the full-fare cost of most high-speed rail tickets.

[Here is a guide on the JR Pass by Japan-Guide](http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2361.html). It will go over how to purchase them, options for extra services, where they are valid, how to use them, and other rules/policies for using them.

It is important to notice that the **JR Pass** commonly spoken of is a nation-wide pass, but there are also *regional or local alternatives* that might be more attractive depending on your itinerary, like the [JR-East passes](https://www.jreast.co.jp/e/pass/index.html) that cover mostly eastern and north-east Japan (Tohoku and Hokkaido) and [JR-West passes](https://www.westjr.co.jp/global/en/ticket/pass/) that cover mostly the Kansai/Kyushu area (Mostly starting from Kyoto and westward). The main caveat of these passes is that they do not cover the most used line for foreigners: Tokyo to/from Kyoto/Osaka. Please see the end of this wiki page for more information.

An additional [fairly comprehensive guide can be found here](http://tokyofromtheinside.com/demystifying-the-railway-train-and-subway-systems-of-tokyo/) introducing how to travel by train in Tokyo.

### Eligibility

#### Am I eligible to use a JR Pass?

The JR Pass is **only** available for use by foreign tourists and Japanese citizens who have resided outside of Japan in one country for 10 years or more. Foreigners residing in Japan under student visas, work visas, spouse/dependent visas, Working Holiday visas, SOFA or any other resident status are ineligible to purchase the JR Pass. Foreigners must be in Japan under a tourist visa or waiver to exchange and use the JR Pass. Please read the [official JR Pass eligibility requirements](http://www.japanrailpass.net/en/about_jrp.html) for more specific information.

### JR Pass Calculator

To assist with helping you determine if a JR Pass is worth it, there is a calculator available at: [http://www.jrpass.com/farecalculator](http://www.jrpass.com/farecalculator)

### How can I get a JR Pass? 

You can get a JR Pass through the following methods:

* Through an authorized travel agency, typically JTB.
* Through one of the two Japan-flagged airlines, assuming you are also travelling with them.
* Through an authorized online retailer.
* In Japan at specific JR Offices, although purchasing within Japan is slightly more expensive. See [here](https://www.japan-rail-pass.com/common-questions/can-i-buy-my-japan-rail-pass-in-japan) for more information. A JR Pass purchased within Japan is the exact same as a JR Pass purchased outside of the country.

[A list of physical sales offices around the world can be found on the Japan Rail Pass Website](http://www.japanrailpass.net/en/purchase.html#step_01). Online JR Pass purchases can be made [here](https://www.japan-rail-pass.com/?ap=j0095g) or [here](https://www.jrpass.com/). JR Pass exchange vouchers purchased online will need to be shipped. There is no printable option. Please allow time for shipping (see next section, "When should I buy my JR Pass?").

When you make your purchase, you are actually purchasing an exchange order that you must have in your hand when you leave for Japan. In Japan, you turn in that exchange order at an exchange office for the actual JR Pass. Note that the name on your JR Pass Exchange Voucher **must** match the name on your passport, as they will compare between the two. There can be slight, irrelevant differences between the two names (such as one lacks a middle name), but they should mostly match. 

### When should I buy my JR Pass?

You should ideally buy your JR Pass a couple of weeks or more before your trip. Most people buy their JR Passes online and buying it 2-4 weeks in advance leaves enough time for shipping (although most JR Pass vendors ship quickly). If you only have a few days before your trip, you really only have two reliable options:

* Purchase your pass in-person at a [physical sales office](http://www.japanrailpass.net/en/purchase.html#step_01).
* Purchase your pass within Japan, although at a slightly more expensive price (see [here](https://www.japan-rail-pass.com/common-questions/can-i-buy-my-japan-rail-pass-in-japan)). A JR Pass purchased within Japan is the exact same as a JR Pass purchased outside of the country. If you choose this option, be sure the math works out in your favor despite the higher cost.

Some JR Pass vendors will ship JR Passes to your hotel in Japan. This can be an option if there is enough time before your intended activation date for your purchase to be processed and ship. Please refer to individual JR Pass vendor websites for more information on shipping rules.
