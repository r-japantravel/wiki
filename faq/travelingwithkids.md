##I'm traveling to Japan with my family/small children. What should I expect?

###When planning your trip

The bigger the family, the more attention spans you'll need to accommodate. And the younger the participants, the more stops you'll need to make for feedings, diaper changes, and naps - among other things. That will possibly cut down on your amount of time to actually sightsee within the city. If you need to bring along a lot of items for babies or toddlers, you'll want to look into Yamato Transport (mentioned above) to get your luggage to and from the airport or hotels that you will be staying at. Trains have some areas to store luggage, but it is not extensive and it can be a hassle trying to get everyone on and off a train quickly while grabbing multiple bags at the same time. Save yourself the trouble and arrange to transfer your luggage instead. **Quite simply, you need to be brutally honest with yourself, and recognize your child's needs and your desires for the trip will be at odds with one another. A search of the sub reveals that not all trips with children will go as planned, and sometimes even end early as "traveling in Japan" is not as difficult as "traveling in Japan with children."**

###When to travel

Spring and Fall are some recommended times of year to travel, because Summer in Japan (June - September) is hot and very humid. In smaller children and babies, dehydration can be a real concern and lead to some issues you may not have been expecting. As a general rule, keep a list of English speaking hospitals available, either written in-hand or on your phone, in case your child begins experiencing the effects of dehydration. If a Summertime trip is unavoidable, frequent stops to cool off and rehydrate are a must, and should be planned as stops on the itinerary. Japan is a country of many vending machines, and fresh bottled water is always relatively easy to find. Most train stations have washrooms in case you need to change or clean up a little one, as will many large shopping centers. These can be good stops to rest, rehydrate, and regroup.

###Booking family-friendly lodging 

Hotels tend to accommodate smaller families (2 adults, and one child for example), so you really need to do your research on what you need for lodgings. While Airbnb has become very popular in the larger cities, it's good to keep in mind that they are restricted under Minpaku Law to only a certain amount of days per year, depending on location. [Please refer to our Airbnb thread that talks at length about the current law and how it's affecting the landscape of bookings in Japan right now.](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/8os3mv/minpaku_law_airbnb_and_you_information_on_the_new/) At the end of the day, the onus is on you to take your time to do your research, *especially if you are travelling with children*. Groups can easily book out a room at a hostel, some will fit up to 8 people in a co-ed dorm if you book early enough, but not all hostels allow children under a certain age. Hotels can be limited to 4 or less people per room, and generally don't come with any kind of en suite to allow cooking for young or fussy eaters.

###Dining 

Booking restaurant reservations when traveling with small children (infants to around age 7-8) comes with its own set of challenges. Most restaurants in Japan are small and may only fit a maximum of 20 people. Some cater only to adults (and might even restrict children under the age of 12 from entering after certain hours), and most will be unable to provide a special menu or seating for children. Because of this, most families will find that Japan's "family restaurants" will accommodate their needs. These restaurants, as the name implies, are popular chains among individuals with small children. The restaurants are generally more noisy, and many have play areas. High chairs and ample changing stations are almost always available. The menus will almost always offer a "kid's meal" of some sort — and most of the larger chains, such as Jonathan's or Gusto, offer items such as pizza, french fries, fried chicken and steamed veggies for pickier eaters. 

It is worth considering booking lodging with a small kitchen or kitchenette, so that special snacks or meals for your children (Especially if they are picky eaters) can prevent the trip from being entirely dominated by kid-friendly fining. 

If you are looking for recommendations on what places to check out with a family, please use [Tabelog](https://tabelog.com/en/) for up-to-date reviews. Note that searching off-hand for locations that are kid-friendly can be tedious and hard to find good locations on the fly, so you may end up having to resort to Google for a more reliable listing. Also, in dire situations, McDonald's is not a terrible alternative — especially when the options are limited, and children are fussy, hungry, and tired.

###Getting around

Consider shipping large luggage or heavy bags via Japan's luggage forwarding services whenever possible. Families traveling by train should have few problems, especially if the children are able to walk unassisted. If you are bringing a stroller or ride-along for smaller children, the areas by priority seats or the handicapped areas will have extra room to accommodate an adult standing with a child in a stroller. If you are using a baby carrier, please note that the trains get very packed early in the morning (7am - 9am) and later in the day (5pm - 9pm), and it can be very squished. It's best to avoid transit during those hours if possible, which means you can easily take that time to grab breakfast or dinner and relax. Waking up early to rush out the door isn't necessary.

###Onsen and ryokan 

Book private/family baths where possible, so that all the little ones can be properly supervised. Be aware that unless you're drawing the water yourself, it can be quite hot, bordering on scalding, and may not be appropriate for infants and toddlers in case of burns. Many onsen prohibit children of a certain age from entering the water.

Oedo Onsen in Tokyo is especially noted for this, and acts as a theme park as well. Ryokan commonly prohibit children under a certain age from staying in the facilities. As ryokan are intended as places to relax, small children can easily become a nuisance to other guests. If you want to stay in a ryokan, it's very important to make sure the facility is child-friendly before booking. Many popular onsen town have larger ryokan-esque resorts that target families. They places of lodging usually have kid-friendly food, games and other forms of entertainment — and a bit of reasonable noise from little ones it expected, if not tolerated. For those looking to have a quiet, relaxing and romantic ryokan experience, it's best to consider leaving the kids at home for this trip.

###What to bring

Aside from the obvious personal necessities, a PocketWifi is advised if you are traveling with small children that will need some level of entertainment or distraction on longer train trips or longer days sightseeing. Younger, fussy kids can be entertained with games and shows on a phone or tablet when vacation becomes too tedious for them, and for first time travelers it can be invaluable to find your way around especially if you get lost. Consider saving the purchase of some baby items like soap, shampoo, diapers, wipes and bottle sanitizers for your arrival in Japan. Visit places like [**Aeon**](https://www.welcome-aeon.com/), [**Yodobashi Camera**](https://www.yodobashi.com/category/141001/141002/), [**Matsumoto Kiyoshi**](http://www.matsukiyo.co.jp/store/corp/c/004416), **7-11**, **Family Mart**, **SUNKUS**, and other chain convenience store for these items, instead of packing them in your luggage from home. Barring any specific concerns, you should be able to find what you need easily, and in enough quantities to last you for the trip.

##What are some places in Tokyo that are kid-friendly?

We have been very lucky to have lots of great recommendations from past travelers and locals for places to take little ones during trips. Please note the following locations are largely in Tokyo, but if you are traveling outside the main city, the search bar should help you find some other locations that are kid-friendly as well!

###Infants and toddlers

**Ueno Park:** Contains a large zoo, small children's amusement park, rental swan/row boats, lots of temples, lots of museums (Tokyo Natural History Museum, for instance) that kids enjoy. Located right outside JR Ueno Station.

**Tama Zoo:** Located an hour outside of Tokyo by train, the website touts the zoo as a place where "animals are displayed under a naturalistic and spectacular habitat." Take the train to either Tama-Dobutsukoen, or Keio Tama Zoo Station.

**Inokashira Koen and Inokashira Zoo:** Lots of kid entertainers like clowns, kid's musicians and balloon art on Saturdays and Sundays. Paddle boats are available to rent, and there is ample playground equipment for children ages 3 and up. Go to the far end of the park for a less-crowded playground. The Inokashira Park Zoo is aimed at children with a guinea pig petting area, small animals etc. Close to Ghibli Museum as well.

**Haru no Ogawa Play Park:** A mud park for young children in Yoyogi. Located 10 minutes by train on the Metro Chiyoda Line from Meiji-Jingumae Harajuku Station to Yoyogi-Koen Station, or 20 minutes on foot from Harajuku Station on foot through Yoyogi Park itself.

**Hanayashiki Amusement Park:** Behind Sensoji Temple in Asakusa, for young children. 20 minutes from Tokyo Station on the Yamanote, with a transfer to the Asakusa Line, or 5 minutes from Asakusa Shrine on foot.

**Asobono:** Massive indoor playplace for little kids located in Tokyo Dome City. This is a great option on rainy days. Located 15 minutes from Tokyo Station on the Marunouchi Line at Korakuen Station, or the Chuo Line at Suidobashi Station.

**Himonya Koen Kodomo Dobutsu Hiroba:** Petting zoo and pony rides for very young children. Can be reached in 40 minutes with walking/transfers from Tokyo Station to Himonya Park.

**Anpanman Children's Museum:** Anpanman is a long-running, insanely popular cartoon for infants and toddlers, and this kid-friendly museum filled with interactive activities is devoted to the bread-headed character and his friends. Located in Yokohama about 1 hour on the train from Tokyo Station to Yokohama Station, then a 15 minute walk to the museum itself.

###Elementary school-aged children

All of the above suggestions are suitable for older children. Additionally, these attractions are suitable for kids in elementary school (under 10):

**Tokyo Disneyland/DisneySea:** The general tips are that Disneyland is geared towards kids, while DisneySea is more for adults. Both are definitely appropriate ways to spend a day with children 5+. [This is an excellent post detailing all the information you'd need to know before heading out or getting tickets,](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/4btb1g/tokyo_disneyland_disney_sea_guide_for_redditors/) but again, ensure you do your OWN research regarding Disney in Japan to determine if it's right for you, your trip and (especially) your budget.

**Suginami Children's Traffic Park:** Kid only park that has free rental pedal karts, bikes etc. set up to look like a mini Tokyo. Located in Suginami Ward, about an hour by bus and train from Tokyo Station.

**Sanrio Puroland:** Indoor theme park best for kids ages 3-13. Located an hour from Tokyo Station, via the Keio and Chuo lines.

**Tachikawa Showa Kinen Koen:** One of the Tokyo suburbs' most popular and famous parks, complete with a massive play area, water park, playgrounds, etc. Located by Tachikawa Station, about 45 minutes via the Chuo Line from Tokyo Station.

**Tokyo Dome City:** A decently sized amusement park suitable for older children and adults. Arcades are also available. Located 15 minutes from Tokyo Station on the Marunouchi Line at Korakuen Station, or the Chuo Line at Suidobashi Station.

**Pokemon Centers:** [Currently, Tokyo is home to four official, large-scale Pokemon Centers](http://www.pokemon.co.jp/gp/pokecen/english/). **Pokemon Center Skytree** by Asakusa, **Pokemon Center Tokyo-Bay** at LaLaPort Odaiba, **Pokemon Center Mega Tokyo** in Sunshine City in Ikebukuro, and the newly opened **Pokemon Center DX** & **Pokemon Cafe in Nihonbashi**. Please note that if you would like to book a space at the Pokemon Cafe in Nihonbashi, it can be done no earlier than a month in advance and it fills up very quickly as it is still quite new. **You cannot walk in to book a reservation, it needs to be done online.** Groups of no larger than 4 are admitted, and the website is in Japanese, so you will need a plugin to translate for you. [More instructions are available here.](https://nintendosoup.com/reserve-table-pokemon-cafe-japan/)

###Tweens and teens

[**Tokyo Character Street:**](http://www.gotokyo.org/en/kanko/chiyoda/education/106.html) Located inside Tokyo Station, it contains shops that sell various toys and other character goods form characters like Snoopy, Hello Kitty, Studio Ghibli, and Pokemon. Some shops are only open for a limited time, and others carry goods that can only be found on Character Street.

**Ghibli Museum:** Very popular museum devoted to the famous Japanese animation studio responsible for films such as *My Neighbor Totoro* and *Kiki's Delivery Service*. All tickets MUST be booked in advance, and the Ghibli Museum website [has a page in English detailing how this can be done](http://www.ghibli-museum.jp/en/ticket-information/). Unless you and your children are fans of the studio and its films, this is not a must-visit. Younger children (under 6) might be bored with the exhibits, which aren't interactive — unless they're also familiar with Ghibli.

**Sailor Moon Store in Harajuku:** Located in the LaForet Buliding, on the B0.5F (one level below the main floor), it has a rotating stock of Sailor Moon items that cannot be easily found online or in other locations. Great for old and new fans alike.

**Otona Joshi Biyory in Tokyo Station** - A bit hard to find, but worth the walk. Carries all sorts of items for girls ages 8 and up, [this link](https://biyory.jp/item/) will give you an idea of what you're looking at for stock.

**Tokyu Plaza Harajuku:** Has some neat shops with toys and the like, which is better for older children. The top floor has a couple large gift shops containing toys and gifts for all ages.

**Kiddyland:** Carries an excellent selection of toys and goods geared toward all ages. Locations are generally in more high-capacity shopping areas, like Omotesando in Harajuku, and near Osaka Station City. A good place to kill some time with little ones, and to check out some of the goods that are available overseas that you might not generally find in North America.

##What areas are inappropriate or dangerous for children to visit?

Seems a bit of a no-brainer, but it's good to mention that some of the more frequently mentioned attractions in Tokyo are not necessarily kid-friendly. Please note the locations and concerns below.

**Robot Restaurant/Kabukicho at Night:** Lots of bars, lots of pornographic shops/stores, very visible sex trade activity. It's fine enough for teens (18+) and adults, but may be confusing for kids. Please carefully research the Robot Restaurant and decide for yourself if the show is something you would want your child to attend. (IE: young women in skimpy costumes in sexualized scenarios.)

**Akihabara:** Lots of pornographic content, and a lot of it is portrayals of very young (animated - but still) girls, some in very sexualized scenarios/poses. There are a few sex shops mixed in with the more "otaku" shops, and even some of the shops that aren't specifically selling explicit pornographic material do contain dolls/images/toys that are geared towards men. Therefore, the girls/women portrayed are generally voluptuous, scantily clad, with a higher than normal degree of anatomical detail. **If you are looking specifically for goods from certain shows, do your research, and check the notations above for some all-ages stores that cater to children.**

**Animate Otome Road, in Ikebukuro:** Most of the store is safe, but there is a section on one of the floors that carries comics that are geared towards women, and feature sexual content. They are generally sealed in plastic, and the staff will probably not sell to minors knowingly. Therefore, it can be avoided and the rest of your time can be spent shopping for plushies and other toys and items geared towards children and girls. Still worth a visit, just be aware any sealed comics more than likely contain explicit material.

**Harajuku/Takeshita Dori:** - Geared towards teenagers, there are definitely some stores selling product that would not be appropriate for children (fetish wear, 420 culture). One of our own Mods, /u/amyranthlovely, spotted a shirt with a tattooed and pierced version of Disney's Little Mermaid on the front, with the words "ROCKER, SUCKER, FUCKER" on the side. Hilarious for an adult, but probably not for some kids. Also notoriously packed on the weekends, it's best to just avoid it if you're traveling with anyone under the age of 15, or children that are prone to distraction and wandering off. The nearby Kiddyland on Omotesando would be a better diversion for the little ones, and there is a Sailor Moon Store in La Foret's secondary basement floor.

##Are there posts about traveling with kids I can reference while planning our trip?

Yes! Traveling with children to Japan is a very common topic on this sub, and there are many old posts that go in-depth on the subject — including some trip reports from parents who have successfully taken their family to Japan.
