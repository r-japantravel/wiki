## Lodging and Accommodations 

When it comes to lodging in Japan, there are many different options at all price points. Although Japan is considered a rather expensive country to travel to, there are still plenty of ways for a budget-minded traveler to have a good trip. 

### What are the various lodging types available to me in Japan?

**Western Style Hotel** 

This is one of the most common accommodation types available in Japan, and these hotels are usually available at many price points. Western Style Hotels will usually offer a hotel room with a private bathroom, a staffed lobby/check-in area, luggage storage before or after check-in, parking options, food options, concierge, and sometimes amenities such as a gym or a pool. Japanese hotel rooms tend to be surprisingly small, especially if you are from North America or Europe.

**Western Style Hostel**

This is one of the most common accommodations available in Japan, and these hostels are usually available at many price points, almost all skewing toward the cheaper end of the spectrum. Like hostels all around the world, you will generally be able to select a cheaper "shared" option which includes a bed in a shared room and access to a shared bathroom, or a more expensive "private" option, which will have a private room and possibly a private bathroom. Hostels tend to have limited amenities, although many have staff available to help answer questions, and often will have common rooms for gathering or kitchens for cooking in.

**Ryokan (Traditional Japanese Inn)**

A ryokan (also known as a Japanese inn) is a type of lodging specific to Japan. Ryokan are a little different than western lodging in terms of amenities. At most ryokan, you will have access to a private room and private bathroom. The room will often have traditional Japanese furnishings such as tatami mat floors and futons for sleeping (rather than beds). Many ryokan will include breakfast, dinner, or both in their room rate. In these cases, meals are usually served at a specific time in a common eating area, and you will be informed of the times at check-in. At some ryokan, dinner is served privately in your room. Ryokan often have shared onsen or onsen-like baths for soaking. If you would like to use the shared bath, observe all the normal rules of etiquette. Ryokan may or may not have a full-time front desk staff or other available amenities. 

Note that in many cases, ryokan are more common away from cities. It's not impossible to find ryokan inside of cities, but it can be less common. Do not expect every place you visit to have ryokan options.

**Japanese Guest House**

A Japanese guest house is a type of medium-to-long term accommodation. In many cases, Japanese guest houses are meant to be a cheap way for foreigners to stay for a month or longer without having to rent their own place (which is extremely difficult or impossible). They tend to be cheap/moderately-priced, light on amenities, and will often feel more like an apartment than a hotel room. Some will be more western (with beds and hard wood floors), while others might be more traditional in nature (futons and tatami mats). 

**AirBnb**

AirBnB is an online house- and room-sharing service that allows owners to rent out their own places to visitors. Generally, renting through AirBnB either gets you a single room within an occupied apartment or home, or a "private AirBnB", where the home/apartment is accessible to only you for the duration of your stay. A single room will usually be cheaper than renting out an entire apartment/home. AirBnB can be a good option for large groups or families who would like more space than other accommodation types will offer in Japan, or who want access to a kitchen for cooking.

**Capsule Hotel**

A capsule hotel is a type of accommodation usually meant for single night stays, although some visitors choose to stay there for some or all of their trips due to the cheap prices. A capsule hotel is a bare-bones place to stay with no amenities. Most capsule hotels will give you a single, "coffin-like" room designed for sleeping. They will often have shared shower/bathroom facilities, and lockers for storing personal effects while you sleep. Most capsule hotels require daily check-out and check-in, with no option to store luggage. This makes them good for a businessman in Japan who needs to stay in the city overnight, or a traveler transiting through a city in one day, but not so good for a tourist who wants to stay in a city for multiple nights or for couples/families. 

Note that many capsule hotels only allow men, or only allow women. Mixed-gender capsule hotels are less common.

**Love Hotel**

A love hotel is a unique type of accommodation primarily used for privacy for sexual activity. These rooms are often available during the day by reservation for a specific amount of time, and are often available at night for overnight stays. Love hotels are often discreet buildings with discreet and/or minimal staff. The rooms are often themed in some way, or "romantically" decorated. When searching online for hotels, love hotels sometimes show as "adult-only" hotels. Overall, love hotels (like capsule hotels) are not ideal for tourist stays, as they often require daily check-out/check-in, and lack amenities. They are more of a novelty than anything else.

**Manga/Internet Cafe**

A manga or internet cafe is not a traditional type of accommodation, but it's worth a mention. A manga and/or internet cafes allows you to pay for a private booth, usually with a chair and computer, usually for a specified amount of time. These cafes tend to have very little in the way of amenities aside from public restrooms and free coffee/tea/soda, but can be a last-minute place to stay for cost reasons or emergencies. See [here](https://tokyocheapo.com/accommodationcat/tokyo-manga-cafes/) for more information.

**Homestay**

Homestays are a type of accommodation where guests can lodge with a host in their home, sometimes with more of an emphasis on cultural or language exchange. Hosts may offer western or Japanese-style rooms and access to a shared bathroom. Many hosts may offer the option to cook meals for you during the day, while others will allow you access to their kitchen. However living in someone’s home means living by their rules. Some hosts are fine with shorter stays, but others will only accept long-term guests, and you may also be sharing a house with other guests. Many hosts may have a curfew in the evening and meal times or bathroom access may be at set times, reducing some flexibility of your day. You should read the hosts rules thoroughly before booking with them.

###I'm hearing mixed things about AirBnB? Is it legal?

AirBnb is technically [legal in Japan nationwide](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-06-09/airbnb-gets-green-light-in-japan-with-home-sharing-law-s-passage) **if** the AirBnb complies with the provisions of [the minpaku law enacted in June 2018](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/community/2018/04/01/how-tos/new-minpaku-law-will-alter-japans-rental-hospitality-landscape/#.WtVZrIhuaI4). Many, but not all, units should be able to comply with these provisions — but if you are unsure of the legality of a particular unit, pick a different AirBnb (ie: one with a high number of verified reviews) or stay in more heavily regulated place of lodging, such as a hotel. It is likely many AirBnbs will close come June 2018 due to owners of units being unable to conform to the minpaku law.

###My AirBnb host is asking for a copy of my passport! Why?

In June 2018, a new law regulating the lease or rental of minpaku (private residences rented out by their owners as short-term lodgings) will go into effect. The terms of this law require minpaku to operate under similar legal guidelines to that of hotels and other legal forms of temporary lodging. These rules include the requirement that identification of foreign visitors to Japan be obtains for security purposes. If you were to stay in a hotel in Japan, a similar request would be made.

If you are uncertain or worried about sharing your identification with an AirBnb host, it is recommended you stay at a large hotel chain or another form of lodging where you are comfortable providing your identification.

###What are some reliable places to look for lodging online?

Although /r/JapanTravel doesn't endorse or guarantee any particular booking website or place of lodging, here's a list of sites our users commonly use:

* [Booking.com](https://www.booking.com/)
* [Agoda](https://www.agoda.com/)

### How should I choose where to stay?

When choosing a location, travelers should consider several factors to help aid in decision making:

* Proximity to attractions and activities of interest to the traveler
* Price
* Styles of lodging available
* Accessibility (for travelers who are disabled or mobility impaired)
* Surrounding environment (ie: Someone who wants a quiet location should probably avodi staying in party districts like Kabukicho or Roppongi)

Almost every major and minor city has extensive options for all types of vacationers. 


###Where should I stay in Tokyo?

Generally, as long as your intended place of lodging is located no further west than Kichijoji and no further east than Oshiage, you will be within a reasonable train ride (~30 mins or less) to most major tourist attractions within Tokyo. Anywhere outside these boundaries will be outside the 23 Wards zone and is likely to be less accessible to areas commonly frequented by tourists. Ideally, your lodging should also be located within 10-15 minutes walking distance from a station served by rapid trains for easy access to major stations such as Shinjuku, Shibuya, Tokyo etc.

The most common neighborhoods that tourists choose to stay in include:

* Shinjuku
* Shibuya
* Asakusa
* Ueno
* Akihabara
* Ginza
* Chiyoda (Tokyo Station area)
* Shinagawa

All of these areas are well-connected to other parts of Tokyo, and offer ample options for eating, drinking, shopping, and sightseeing. If you're a first time visitor to Tokyo, you might want to have a look at [this](https://www.youcouldtravel.com/travel-blog/where-to-stay-in-tokyo-for-tourists-and-first-time-visitors) more in-depth article.

### Where should I stay in Kyoto?

As in other cities, staying within reasonable walking distance (for most people, 5-15 minutes) of a train station is desirable. Beyond that, where you stay in Kyoto is dependent on what you want to see and do. 

Kyoto has almost all available lodging types, but people often choose to stay at a ryokan (traditional Japanese inn, see above for details). Especially if you aren't spending the night in a famous onsen (hot springs) town, Kyoto can offer a great opportunity to experience this interesting aspect of traditional Japanese culture.

Some common areas that tourists choose to stay in include:

* Kyoto Station area
* Downtown Kyoto
* Central Kyoto
* Southern Higashiyama (including Gion)

### Where should I stay in Osaka?

As in other cities, staying within reasonable walking distance (for most people, 5-15 minutes) of a train station is desirable. Beyond that, where you stay in Osaka is dependent on what you want to see and do. 

Some common areas that tourists choose to stay in include:

* Kita/Umeda/Osaka Station area
* Namba/Minami
* Honmachi (Central Osaka)
* Tennoji
* Shin-Osaka

### Should I stay in Osaka or Kyoto?

This question comes up a lot in /r/JapanTravel, and it's largely a matter of personal preference. 

To start with, it is *extremely easy and cheap to commute between Osaka and Kyoto**. They are anywhere from 20-35 minutes apart by train (depending on your exact starting point and train type), so don't feel like you're making a drastic mistake by picking one over the other. Many people choose to base themselves in one city and make day trips to the other (as well as the rest of Kansai), and that's perfectly fine and doable. 

**Pros and cons of staying in Kyoto:** 

* Pro: a lot of people consider Kyoto to have "more to do". It has more temples/shrines, cultural events, parks/gardens, and historical sites. People often consider Kyoto to be the "main attraction" of Kansai.
* Pro: it is closer to Tokyo, Hakone, Nagoya, Uji than Osaka is, and close to Nara.
* Con: it can be more expensive to stay in.
* Con: it can be harder to find accommodations, especially during busy seasons.
* Con: there isn't much to do at night. Kyoto sort of "shuts down" and gets quiet in the evening.

**Pros and cons of staying in Osaka:**

* Pro: it is a great city for night-life, food, and shopping. There is a lot to do in the evening since stuff doesn't shut down as totally.
* Pro: it is closer to Kobe and Hiroshima than Kyoto is, and also close to Nara.
* Pro: it can be cheaper to stay here than in Kyoto.
* Con: people don't consider it to have as much to do as Kyoto. It is lacking as many cultural/historical sites as Kyoto.
* Con: if you think you'll be spending a lot of time seeing Kyoto sites, you lose some time each day commuting to Kyoto from Osaka.

###Where can I do my laundry?

If you are staying in a higher-end Western or business hotel, many will have a laundry service but this is often very expensive - especially if you have a large load of washing to do. Some hotels and hostels may offer a coin laundry. At AirBnb's/Guesthouses/etc you may have access to a regular domestic washing machine. If not, inputting ‘コインランドリー’ into Google Maps will direct you to your nearest coin laundry (this may also throw up some dry cleaning results, check the pictures beforehand to ensure a location is in fact a coin laundry before setting off with your washing).

####How do I use the machines at a coin laundry?

When at a coin laundry, make sure you have the right machine (washer or dryer) if they're separate, or select the right course if it's a combined washer/dryer. Different laundry chains all have different machines and they all vary in looks slightly but 洗濯 is for wash and 乾燥 for dry. Then figure out if it includes detergent in the cycle - 洗剤不要 or 洗剤は必要ありません will tell you that you don't need detergent.

If you want to clean out the drum before you start, there might be a ドラム洗浄 option. Then select the course that's best for your load of washing (there might be smaller or bigger machines that list the maximum load or if it's a big machine there might be several loads to choose from, 8kg 15kg etc) and usually the time it takes will be displayed on the button before you start. Again, 洗濯 for wash and 乾燥 for dry. In the case of a washer/dryer, if the course displays Kanji for both it'll dry after the wash cycle is complete without you needing to do anything. 

Most standalone dryers have a flat rate for so many minutes. For example, if the charge is ¥100 for 10 minutes but you want to dry your clothes for 30 minutes, you must insert ¥300 at once for an uninterrupted 30 minute dry.

Once you've selected the best course for your load of washing, nsert your money into the coin slot (make sure to bring plenty of ¥100 coins, not all laundrettes are guaranteed to have a change making machine, and only some places accept ¥500) and the machine will start automatically. If if does not start automatically, you might need to press a スタート button somewhere. Once the machine starts, you can't stop the cycle or change the course once it's begun. The door locks until the end of the cycle so double check you've put all your washing in and have the right course selected before putting your money in. Most machines will have a countdown timer. Once it's started, you can stay at the laundrette, but going out is also fine so long as you return on time to get your washing so as to not inconvenience others, especially if the launderette is busy. There might be trolleys there to help you unload your washing and for you to fold it all on as well.
