# Shopping

Shopping can be a big part of many travellers trips to Japan. Depending on what you are looking to buy, there is a range of stores that will cater to your needs. 

## What kinds of shops can I find in Japan?

###Convenience Stores

Convenience stores are found all over Japan, open 24/7 they are often the easiest place to find any essentials at a decent price. You can buy prepared food which can be heated up for you, basic clothing and toiletries as well as books and magazines. Convenience stores may also offer a range of other services, such as photocopying, ticket purchasing for various events and even luggage forwarding.

###1 Coin, 3 Coin and 5 Coin Shops

1 Coin, 3 Coin and 5 Coin Shops (100 yen, 300 yen and 500 yen shops respectively), sell a huge range of products at a discount price. The quality of goods are still on par with what you would find elsewhere, and they are easy places to find items that are unique to Japan.

###Department Stores

Department stores can be found all over Japan, and are often connected to larger train stations. You can find a mix of western and Japanese brands selling a range of goods. Most department stores will also have a basement floor dedicated to food, and some restaurant floors where you can eat a wide range of world cuisine. If you plan on spending a lot, be sure to check whether you can take advantage of the Tax Free program and how it works in that particular department store.

###Shopping Malls

Shopping malls in Japan are bright, clean and modern. You can find a mix of western and Japanese brands selling a range of goods. They are open into the evening and aside from shops, may host restaurant floors, a food court and cinema. Individual shops may offer Tax Free purchases, you can check at the customer information counter which shops provide this service.

###Shopping Streets/Arcades

Shopping streets/arcades are home to many individual sellers and are a good place to find cheap clothing or souvenirs as well as fresh produce. Examples of popular shopping streets include Nakamise-dori in Tokyo, Teramachi in Kyoto and Tenjinbashisuji in Osaka.

###Markets

Morning markets are held up and down Japan where you can find fresh produce and snacks and even some handmade crafts. Closing days differ between the morning markets and can be irregular so it is recommended to check before you travel.

###Antique and Flea Markets

Antique and Flea markets are held early mornings once or twice a month, many on shrine and temple grounds. These markets are a great place to find interesting and unique second hand or antique goods. Be sure to bring change and bags to carry your purchases back with you, and bartering is mostly accepted within reason. You can find listings for antique and flea markets held in most cities across Japan by searching online.

## How does Tax-Free Shopping (menzei, 免税) work?

If you spend at least ¥5,000 in one transaction in a participating shop and you are not a Japanese citizen, you can avoid paying or receive a refund of your consumption tax (8%) by showing your passport and filling out a form. Ask the stores about this, at some stores it is done at point of sale and you're never charged the tax at all, whereas at other stores you have to go a special desk or counter to get your refund.

If you spend at least ¥5,000 (and less than ¥500,000) in one transaction in a participating shop on consumable items (makeup, food, cigarettes, etc.) and you are not a Japanese citizen, you may be able to not pay consumption tax in a similar manner on these items. NOTE: Consumable items must be kept sealed in the bag they are delivered to you in until you leave Japan. If you use a consumable item you got a tax exemption for while in Japan, you can theoretically be charged the consumption tax when you leave the country. You also must leave Japan with your consumables within 30 days for the exemption to remain.

In either case, the shop will insert a form into your passport that you turn in at a customs desk on your way out of the country. [More info here.](http://tax-freeshop.jnto.go.jp/eng/shopping-guide.php)
