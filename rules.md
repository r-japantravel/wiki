# Rules Introduction

This subreddit is for discussion related to travelling in Japan as a Tourist.  As such, we have developed the below rules to help guide discussion, keep the community clean and promote a healthy community.  Should you have any questions, you are encouraged to contact the moderators regarding a [Rules Inquiry](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FJapanTravel&subject=Rules%20Inquiry).

--------------------
# Subreddit Rules

## Unrelated to Tourism in Japan

This subreddit is intended for those travelling within Japan as a tourist.  General posts about travel, airlines, accommodations, or other destinations should be posted in r/travel or r/flights. Posts about living in Japan, whether temporarily or permanently belong, in either r/movingtojapan, r/teachinginjapan, or r/japanlife. Translation requests should be posted in r/translator. Posts that belong in other subreddits will be removed or redirected.

## Do your homework before you post

Read the [FAQ](/r/JapanTravel/wiki/faqs/japantravel), check out the [General Advice](/r/JapanTravel/wiki/advice) page, search the subreddit, and do a cursory Google search before you submit a question. Easily researched or commonly repeated questions will be removed. (This also includes questions about purchasing or using a JR Pass, as the FAQ contains an [extensive page](/r/JapanTravel/wiki/advice/transport/jrpass) on this topic). If you've done your homework but still don't have an answer to your questions, create a descriptive post that includes the research you've done.

### Examples
#### Allowed
> I'm deciding between a hotel that's a 10 minute walk from Shinjuku Station, or one that's right next to Shinagawa Station. They are about equal in price and amenities. I've heard Shinjuku can be quite loud and busy at night, so I'm looking for something more low-key. Shinagawa seems quieter, but will I still be able to do things there like have a drink or get dinner? I don't want it to be completely dead. What are your experiences in either location?

#### Disallowed
>Where should I stay in Tokyo? There are so many great options!

## No low effort posts

Be specific in the questions you're asking. Include information such as: Where you're starting; YOUR dates of travel; budget; genera; interests or things you like to do. This information can have a significant impact on the suggestions the community provides to you. Posts that contain minimal information ("Where should I go?"), excessively broad questions ("Tips for Tokyo?"), or other low effort / karma-gleaning posts ("I miss Japan!") will be removed.

Direct links to external sites (blogs, travel sites, certain image & video hosts, etc.) are flagged as spam and removed.   If you want to share something interesting from external sites, link it in a text post and provide comments to encourage discussion.

Clickbait, spam, memes, ads, brochures, surveys, information crowdsourcing is not allowed. Users who post such content face a potential ban.

We take the sharing of external content seriously here as it can easily veer into self-promotion if not regulated. Even if this isn't your content, this serves as a warning and reminder of the rules.

## Itinerary Post Guidelines

Itinerary posts must be clearly identified in their titles, and must include more information than dates and location. Simply listing a date and a location is not considered ample information. We are not your travel agents, and it is not the job of the sub to fill the gaps in your itinerary for you. Itinerary posts must have sufficient supporting information and specific questions so that the community can help. Any itinerary post that does not meet these requirements will be removed.

### Examples
#### GOOD ITINERARY
Hello /r/JapanTravel! My roommate and I are traveling to Tokyo for the first time next month and we could not be more excited. We work in the beauty and fashion industry, so we’ve structured this trip around shopping, specifically for cosmetics and vintage clothes. If we’re missing any great neighborhood for this in our itinerary, please let us know! Right now, we just want to make sure our plan is feasible.

May 1 - Land at Narita at 3pm. Narita Express to our hotel (Hotel ABC) in Shinjuku. We hope we’re not too jet lagged to get dinner and wander around Kabukicho!

May 2 - Shimokitazawa (shopping) and possibly stay in the area for dinner. We think we’ll spend all day here.

May 3 - Shibuya and Harajuku. We’re getting an early start to see Meiji Jingu before going shopping. My friend wants to eat at Kawaii Monster Cafe, and we have reservations at 1pm.

May 4 - Morning shopping at Isetan in Shinjuku, then makeup and skincare shopping in Shin-Okubo. Dinner in Shin-Okubo.

May 5 - Day trip to Kamakura

May 6 - Shopping in Kichijoji in the morning/afternoon, then shopping in Koenji in the afternoon/early evening before dinner with a mutual friend who lives nearby.

May 7 - Matsumoto Kyoshi and Ainz&Tulpe for final cosmetics shopping before taking the Narita Express back to the airport at 3pm

#### BAD ITINERARY
My new spouse and I are honeymooning in Japan next month! We love everything anime and games, so please give us your suggestions! Here’s where we want to go. What should we do?

May 1 through May 5 - Tokyo

May 5 through 7 - Kyoto

May 8 - Osaka

May 9 through 10 - Fukuoka (it’s the setting of our favorite anime, Anime Show XYZ)

May 11 - Flight home from Fukuoka airport

## No self promotion

If you want to submit your own content, its primary goal should be to drive or jumpstart discussion on r/JapanTravel. (A example of this are trip reports that include links to photo albums hosted on a third party site.) If the primary outcome of your post, regardless of your original intent, is to drive traffic to your blog/vlog/Instagram/portfolio/etc., your post will be removed.

Selfies, vlogs and videos, personal blog links or other forms of self-promotion (especially GoFundMe campaigns) are not allowed. Users who post such content face a potential ban.

## No Meet-up Requests

Meet-up requests for tourists or transient travelers are only allowed in official Mega Meet-Up thread stickied at the top of the sub.  A new thread is automatically created each month, so please keep meet-up related posts limited to the thread that corresponds to the month you'll be visiting Japan.

## No solicitation posts

This includes: souvenir/merchandise purchase requests, accommodation/restaurant booking requests, event ticket purchasing requests, or location photo/video requests. The only exception to this rule is that we allow ticket resale in the monthly meet-up thread only. Posts that violate this rule will be removed.

## No "meta" posts about this sub

We do not allow meta posts to be posted within this subreddit.  Examples include "Why do people post the same itineraries all the time?".  No PMs to individual mods about removed comments or posts. Problems or questions should be directed to moderators via the mod mail interface.

## Be civil

Harassment of other users or mods, trolling, posting of users' personal information, repeated intentional rule breaking, or other general unsavory behavior will be met with bans.

## Trip reports and other informative posts are welcome on this subreddit

If you are going to share your experience by writing a trip report, review, guide, or set of tips, please make sure you do so in an organized and detailed fashion. Such posts should be made as text posts only, with any photos or relevant external content linked within the post.

--------------------
# Actions against users

Warnings, Suspensions and Bans from the Subreddit are some of the possible actions we will take against users.

## Policy

The current policy for warning, suspending and banning a user is a member will be given 1 warning, then if problems still persist, a suspension (temporary ban of anywhere from 3-14 days depending on the severity of the infraction) will be issued. If the user continues to not follow directions, a permanent ban will be levied against a user.

### Warnings

Warnings are tracked using our modtools.  Users will not be able to see their warnings, however should they have any questions they are more then welcome to message the moderators.

### Suspensions

Likewise, suspensions are tracked with our modtools.  Suspensions will vary in length from 3 to 14 days depending on the infraction.  Moderators will be given the leeway to determine the length of the suspension within these guidelines and users are free to appeal the length by messaging the moderators or replying to the ban notification private message.

### Bans

Bans are levied against users that continue to not follow the rules of the subreddit and are permanent in nature.  Should you be given a ban, you are free to continue reading the subreddit and you are welcome to contact the moderators to appeal by either messaging the moderators or replying to the ban notification private message.

### Exceptions

For egregious violations, moderates are able to make exceptions to the standard policy for warning/suspension/ban.  These will be handled on a case by case basis and users are welcome to contact the moderators with questions or to appeal any actions taken against them.

--------------------
# Interacting with the moderators

## Reporting Threads

**Reports made on comments or posts are anonymous.** You can feel free to report anything you want, and your name will not show up on the report. This means you can report comments made by mods or other community members without fearing retaliation. That said, we'd appreciate reports being relevant (the content actually breaks the rules), civil (no swearing or threatening), and not done just as a means of attacking someone.

## Moderators

**Moderators are unpaid volunteers.** All of the mods here (and all around reddit) receive no compensation or perks for our roles. We moderate this subreddit in our spare time around other commitments because we enjoy doing so and want to help the community. If we are slow to respond in mod mail or to other inquiries, it's because we aren't on here 24/7, and we can't communicate with each other to make decisions instantaneously. We do our best and try to get to everything as quickly as we can.

### Moderator Conduct

As a group, the moderators have agreed on the following points of conduct:

* Mods will not post /r/JapanTravel threads to /r/JapanCircleJerk.
* Mods will be cordial and polite when responding in mod mail.
* Mods will follow a proper escalation path for user bans.
* Mods will provide removal reasons for all removed posts.
* Mod will not belittle or attack members of the /r/JapanTravel community, and will do their best to foster a healthy and welcoming environment.

#Reporting inappropriate content

Everyone is entitled to free speech, even if they're are being insulting or unhelpful. Reporting stuff like hurt feelings is likely to be ignored. We rely on reddiquitte to define the borderline when comments become offensive, targeted or hateful and need to be removed.

If comments or posts violate reddiquitte please report it with the appropriate reason.
