#Tourist Visas and Waivers

Any foreign visitor who wishes to enter Japan must have a passport with at minimum six months of validity from the time the visitor enters Japan. In order to enter Japan, visitors usually must comply with the conditions of their visas and authorizations of resident eligibility — which, for tourists who are not on a Working Holiday Visa, generally means that the purpose of the visit must be for sightseeing purposes and the visitor must not engage in activities where they earn compensation. (For more information on the Working Holiday Visa, please visit [/r/movingtojapan](http://reddit.com/r/movingtojapan). and the [Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs](http://www.mofa.go.jp/j_info/visit/w_holiday/).)

Depending on your country of citizenship, you may be required to obtain a **tourist visa** before arriving to Japan. If you have any questions about the visa process, please contact the Japanese Embassy or Consulate in your country of citizenship as they are best equipped to answer your questions.

Over sixty countries currently have a reciprocal visa arrangement with Japan which allows for a visa-free stay of 90 days or less. Contrary to popular belief, citizens of countries who fall under this arrangement do not receive a visa, but instead receive a **visa waiver**. The terms of the visa waiver are similar to that of traditional tourist visas — meaning that the visit must be for sightseeing purposes and the visitor must not engage in activities where they earn compensation. 

Because both the tourist visa and tourist waiver give an individual permission to travel to Japan for tourism purposes, tourist waivers are often referred to as tourist visas, despite having different requirements than a true Japanese "tourist visa." This may often lead to confusion among travelers. However, the guidelines below should help visitors to Japan better understand whether they need a visa or fall under the tourist waiver.

Arriving in Japan without a visa or overstaying your visa/visa waiver makes you liable for deportation, detention or both. You alone are responsible for ensuring you have the proper materials needed to enter Japan prior to leaving for your trip.

###Countries with Visa Exemptions

Nationals and citizens of those countries and regions shown below are not required to obtain visas to enter Japan when their visits are strictly for tourism, commerce, conferences, visiting relatives/acquaintances, etc. However, when foreign nationals engage in paid activities in Japan, or their periods of stay exceed those stipulated in each country’s arrangement of short-term stay, visas will be required to enter Japan.

Some countries have specific provisions (including passport compatibility) regarding their visa arrangements, so please [consult the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs website](http://www.mofa.go.jp/j_info/visit/visa/short/novisa.html) for more information.

###Countries that require visas

Nationals of countries that do not have a reciprocal visa arrangement with Japan **must** obtain a visa prior to arrival. Please see the information below supplied by the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs if you are a visitor from a country that does not fall under the countries with the visa exemption programs listed above.

###Working in Japan Under a Tourist Visa or Waiver

Working in Japan while on a tourist visa or waiver is **illegal** — whether for financial gain, in exchange for college credit, in exchange for room and board or as a part of an internship program. Any of the aforementioned scenarios instead require a **work visa** or **permission to engage in activity other than that permitted waiver** (only intended for students or dependents/spouses). (Short-term study at a Japanese language school within the length of your visa or visa waiver is permitted. However, any length of student longer than the term of your visa or waiver would require a student visa. You may not work as a short-term study student.)

Individuals entering Japan for the purpose of work or work training (ie: internships) without the proper visa are subject to detention and/or deportation.

Additionally, companies who offer internships or job "training period" offers to foreigners without issuing the proper work visa often have reputations for being "black companies" — companies with poor or questionable business practices that operate outside the scope of Japanese labor laws.

Japanese labor laws are intended to protect workers. By not following the law and working under a tourist visa, you lose the many protections that the labor laws would provide in a traditional work visa situation.

Volunteering is a grey area that isn't clearly defined by these rules. However, it is always best to err on the side of caution and not engage in anything that would be considered job-like while in Japan as a tourist.

###Extending a tourist visa waiver

If passport holders of a visa-exempted country (visa waiver) want to continue their stay in Japan over 90 days, they must apply for an extension of period of stay at a local immigration office before the expiry date. [Please visit the MOFA website for more information, and to find the application for for Temporary Visitor extensions](http://www.immi-moj.go.jp/english/tetuduki/kanri/shyorui/03-format.html).
