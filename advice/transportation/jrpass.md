#All About the JR Pass

[Here is a guide on the JR Pass by Japan-Guide](http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2361.html). It will go over how to purchase them, options for extra services, where they are valid, how to use them, and other rules/policies for using them.

It is important to notice that the **JR Pass** commonly spoken of is a nation-wide pass, but there are also *regional or local alternatives* that might be more attractive depending on your itinerary, like the [JR-East passes](https://www.jreast.co.jp/e/pass/index.html) that cover mostly eastern and north-east Japan (Tohoku and Hokkaido) and [JR-West passes](https://www.westjr.co.jp/global/en/ticket/pass/) that cover mostly the Kansai/Kyushu area (Mostly starting from Kyoto and westward). The main caveat of these passes is that they do not cover the most used line for foreigners: Tokyo to/from Kyoto/Osaka. Please see the end of this wiki page for more information.

An additional [fairly comprehensive guide can be found here](http://tokyofromtheinside.com/demystifying-the-railway-train-and-subway-systems-of-tokyo/) introducing how to travel by train in Tokyo.

##Basics

### What is the JR Pass?

The **[Japan Rail Pass](http://www.japanrailpass.net/en/)** (commonly referred to as the JR Pass) is a cost-effective rail pass for long distance train travel in Japan. The JR Pass offers unlimited use of JR trains throughout Japan for one, two or three weeks at a highly reduced rate compared to the full-fare cost of most high-speed rail tickets.

### Am I eligible to use a JR Pass?

The JR Pass is **only** available for use by foreign tourists and Japanese citizens who have resided outside of Japan in one country for 10 years or more. Foreigners residing in Japan under student visas, work visas, spouse/dependent visas, Working Holiday visas, SOFA or any other resident status are ineligible to purchase the JR Pass. Foreigners must be in Japan under a tourist visa or waiver to exchange and use the JR Pass. Please read the [official JR Pass eligibility requirements](http://www.japanrailpass.net/en/about_jrp.html) for more specific information.

### How can I get a JR Pass? 

You can get a JR Pass through the following methods:

* Through an authorized travel agency, typically JTB.
* Through one of the two Japan-flagged airlines, assuming you are also travelling with them.
* Through an authorized online retailer.
* In Japan at specific JR Offices, although purchasing within Japan is slightly more expensive. See [here](https://www.japan-rail-pass.com/common-questions/can-i-buy-my-japan-rail-pass-in-japan) for more information. A JR Pass purchased within Japan is the exact same as a JR Pass purchased outside of the country.

[A list of physical sales offices around the world can be found on the Japan Rail Pass Website](http://www.japanrailpass.net/en/purchase.html#step_01). Online JR Pass purchases can be made [here](https://www.japan-rail-pass.com/?ap=j0095g) or [here](https://www.jrpass.com/). JR Pass exchange vouchers purchased online will need to be shipped. There is no printable option. Please allow time for shipping (see next section, "When should I buy my JR Pass?").

When you make your purchase, you are actually purchasing an exchange order that you must have in your hand when you leave for Japan. In Japan, you turn in that exchange order at an exchange office for the actual JR Pass. Note that the name on your JR Pass Exchange Voucher **must** match the name on your passport, as they will compare between the two. There can be slight, irrelevant differences between the two names (such as one lacks a middle name), but they should mostly match. 

### When should I buy my JR Pass?

You should ideally buy your JR Pass a couple of weeks or more before your trip. Most people buy their JR Passes online and buying it 2-4 weeks in advance leaves enough time for shipping (although most JR Pass vendors ship quickly). If you only have a few days before your trip, you really only have two reliable options:

* Purchase your pass in-person at a [physical sales office](http://www.japanrailpass.net/en/purchase.html#step_01).
* Purchase your pass within Japan, although at a slightly more expensive price (see [here](https://www.japan-rail-pass.com/common-questions/can-i-buy-my-japan-rail-pass-in-japan)). A JR Pass purchased within Japan is the exact same as a JR Pass purchased outside of the country. If you choose this option, be sure the math works out in your favor despite the higher cost.

Some JR Pass vendors will ship JR Passes to your hotel in Japan. This can be an option if there is enough time before your intended activation date for your purchase to be processed and ship. Please refer to individual JR Pass vendor websites for more information on shipping rules.

##Validity

### What trains are the JR Pass valid for? 

The Japan Rail Pass is valid on:

* **JR trains**: The pass is valid on almost all trains operated on the nationwide Japan Railways (JR) network, including shinkansen (high speed), limited express, express, rapid and local trains. Trains that are not operated by Japan Railways (ie: Tokyo Subway, Keio Line, Odakyu Line) are not covered by this pass.
* **Tokyo Monorail** to/from Haneda Airport.
* **N'EX** to/from Narita Airport.
* **JR Ferry** to Miyajima.
* **Non-JR trains with access isolated JR lines**: A small number of non-JR trains provide access remote, isolated JR lines that would otherwise be inaccessible by using the JR pass alone. However, pass holders may only get on and off at stations that provide a transfer to JR lines. These lines include: Aoimori Railway between Aomori, Noheji and Hachinohe to access the JR Ominato Line to the Shimokita Peninsula; IR Ishikawa Railway between Kanazawa and Tsubata to access the JR Nanao Line to the Noto Peninsula; Ainokaze Toyama Railway between Toyama and Takaoka to access the JR Himi Line and JR Johana Line.
* **Local JR buses**: The pass is valid on local buses operated by JR (but not on highway buses). There are not many of these buses, but the following services can be useful to foreign tourists: Yamaguchi - Hagi; Kyoto Station - Ryoanji - Takao; Kanazawa Station - Kenrokuen; JR buses to Lake Towada; JR tourist loop bus in Hiroshima; JR city buses around Sapporo; JR local bus to Kusatsu Onsen.

### What are the exact days my JR Pass is valid for? 

The validity period of the Japan Rail Pass is based on calendar days (midnight to midnight) rather than 24 hour periods. For example: when starting to use a 7-day pass at noon on day 1, it will expire at midnight at the end of day 7 rather than at noon of day 8.

If you happen to be on a train when the JR Pass expires, you can complete that journey without issue, but you cannot start a new train journey.

### Can I get a refund on my JR Pass?

You can generally only get a refund on *unused*, *unexchanged* JR Pass vouchers, usually less some sort of processing fee. Please check with your individual JR Pass vendor for their rules.

##Should I buy a JR pass?

### Is the JR Pass worth it for my itinerary? 

A good first step is to try your itinerary out at [this JR Pass Fare Calculator](http://www.jrpass.com/farecalculator). With that estimate in hands, you can compare the prices of every trip and check what can and cannot be used with the JR Pass. Also check out /u/roygbiv0415's [table of common Shinkansen trip fares](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/43tv2d/a_handy_table_i_made_of_shinkansen_ticket_prices/).

For a manual method to check if the JR Pass is right you, the following step-by-step guide can help you decide, but ultimately its worth/value is up to you since there can be non-monetary reasons for choosing a JR passes or not (see next section).

1. Start a spreadsheet or other document for recording prices. It'll be easier to tally things up and make modifications later.
2. Figure out your travel dates and length of stay in each city. Most of the worth of passes are in travel between cities, not in local metro lines.
3. Plug in your Shinkansen (bullet train) trips into [Hyperdia](http://www.hyperdia.com/en/). Make sure you are using correct station names (e.g.: Shin-Osaka is where the Shinkansen goes through, not Osaka Station) -- Hyperdia requires station names at origin and destination points, not general city or area names. You'll also want expand the "more options" dropdown and uncheck the "NOZOMI / MIZUHO / HAYABUSA (SHINKANSEN)" box, since the JR Pass isn't valid on those trains.
4. This should give you a rough estimate of how much each trip should cost. Note that on Hyperdia the cost is split into the fare + seat reservation, with the total cost at the top of the trip ([example](http://i.imgur.com/pNc7MXK.jpg)). The seat reservation column is *not* optional; you must select (and pay for) something in each drop down in that column. If you decide you don't want reserved seats, pick "unreserved seat" from the dropdown, but note that you can't just ignore the seat reservation fee! This is actually because the trains are charged as base fare + 'limited express supplement' + seat reservation fee. Hyperdia combines the last 2 things into one selection, but the limited express supplements aren't optional. The total at the top is the amount you would be paying for the trip.
5. [Compare it to the current rates for the JR-Pass](http://www.japanrailpass.net/en/about_jrp.html#bm_002) or the other passes for [JR-East](https://www.jreast.co.jp/e/pass/index.html) and [JR-West](https://www.westjr.co.jp/global/en/ticket/pass/).

**Some rules of thumb to keep in mind:**

* The JR Pass is *not always a good deal* (see next point). If you do out all the math and it's not worthwhile for you, that is completely normal.
* The JR Pass almost always *requires* long-distance Shinkansen travel to make it a worthwhile purchase. If you are staying in one city or one small area for your entire trip (e.g. Tokyo), it will be *very difficult* to make the JR Pass worthwhile. 
* The JR Pass is usually *not* a good deal if you're only going one way -- for example, flying into Tokyo, taking the Shinkansen to Osaka, then flying out of Osaka.
* The 7-Day JR Pass is *usually* worthwhile for at least a round-trip between Tokyo and Kyoto/Osaka, with some additional usage locally in Tokyo and Osaka.
* The 14 Day JR Pass is *usually* worthwhile for at least a round-trip between Tokyo and Hiroshima (usually with some stopping in the Kyoto/Osaka area), as well as some day-trips and local train usage in Tokyo.

###I only want to use the JR Pass within a single city for local or semi-local train rides. Will it be worth it?

Short answer: **Probably not.**

It's *very* hard to make a JR Pass worth it when you're only doing inexpensive intra-city travel. Most local train trips cost anywhere from ￥140 to ￥340, depending on distance traveled. Traveling outside a city (ie: Tokyo to Yokohama, Kyoto to Osaka) will roughly cost anywhere from ￥500 to ￥800 depending on your starting station.

To make a 7-Day JR Pass "pay off" for a trip that only includes one or two cities within an hour or less of each other, you'd need to take anywhere from 100-200 train trips within the validity period of the pass — an extremely impossible feat. On average, tourists use trains anywhere from 1x to 5x a day.

If your trip doesn't involve Shinkansen travel but involves travel to a destination 1-2hrs away by regular trains, look into local passes such as the Hakone Free Pass. Tobu All-Nikko Pass, etc. These are cost-saving passes intended for travel to sightseeing locations near large cities for trips that not necessitate a JR Pass.

### The JR Pass is only barely worth it for my trip. Should I get it anyway for convenience? 

Some people do out all the math and find the JR Pass _doesn't quite_ become worthwhile for them, or only barely breaks even cost-wise. In those cases, it can be a matter of personal preference whether to get a JR Pass or not. 

Some pros of the JR Pass (aside from cost savings):

* You can usually avoid the time and effort of buying individual tickets (through the use of non-reserved seating cars).
* You can have flexibility in timing/scheduling because you don't need to buy tickets for a specific train.
* You can go in and out of JR ticket gates as many times as needed without paying. (This can be handy for accessing things inside payment gates, like luggage lockers or shops.)

Some cons of the JR Pass:

* You will have to wait in line to exchange your voucher for the JR Pass at some point during your trip.
* You will need to use manned gates to get in and out of JR stations, rather than automatic gates. In most large stations, this isn't a problem since they are plentiful and at every entrance/exit. In some smaller stations or crowded stations, you may need to find the particular entrance/exit that has a manned gate, or wait in line at the manned gate to get through.
* You will probably need to carry it in addition to an IC card, as the JR Pass will usually not cover all train travel you plan to do.
* If you lose your JR Pass, you are out of luck, as you have just effectively lost *all* your train travel tickets. 

### The JR Pass is only barely worth it for my trip, or my travel is estimated as several thousand yen or more under the pass's cost. Can I make up the difference with local, intracity travel on JR lines?

That depends. Remember that most local train trips cost 140 - 340 yen, and you probably won't be making that many of them per day. Also keep in mind that certain cities don't have many or any JR lines. In Tokyo, the JR Pass can be quite useful for using the Yamanote line and the Chuo line to get around to popular tourist locations. In Kyoto, people find the JR Pass less useful for local train travel. 

In general, it's not advisable to bank on making up large discrepancies with local travel. That said, it varies a lot based on your particular itinerary and travel style. If you will be hopping on and off JR trains multiple times a day in a city, you will have a better chance of making up the cost. If you are in a city with not a lot of JR coverage or you don't plan on using JR trains a lot, making up the cost will be much harder. Also don't forget to factor in travel between cities in airports -- in some cities, that is covered by the JR Pass and can cost a non-trivial amount of money.

##Choosing a pass

### What is the difference between the JR Pass Ordinary and the JR Pass Green?

The differences between Green JR Passes and Ordinary JR Passes can be compared to the difference between economy and premium economy on a large commercial airline. Most passengers will find that the "ordinary" cars on Shinkansen trains are already quite comfortable and contain a nice variety of amenities. For this reason, a majority of travelers to Japan will find that the Green JR Pass is an unnecessary added expense for their trip. Due to the price difference, Green cars are usually less crowded and easier to reserve in short notice.

**Ordinary Car Features**

* 2-3 seat configuration (though some Kodama and Sakura train lines feature 2-2 seat configurations in ordinary cars)
* Seat size 430mm width
* Increased seat pitch/legroom 980mm 
* Seat recline 15°
* One AC outlet per row (on wall)
* Tray capable of holding 5kg of weight
* 180° rotating seats (for groups of 3-4 traveling together to face one another)
* Overhead racks for luggage or personal items
* Luggage storage for 6-8 large bags at the front and rear of cars

[Here](https://imgcp.aacdn.jp/img-a/1200/auto/global-aaj-front/article/2017/04/58ed8d8144911_58ed7f3ac9981_1263240948.jpg) is an example of a regular train car on the Tokaido Shinkansen. 

**Green Car Features**

Green Cars include all features of the Ordinary cars with some additions or upgrades, including:

* 2-2 seat configuration
* Increased seat size (465mm-475mm width)
* Increased seat pitch/legroom (1040mm-1160mm)
* Increased seat recline (40°)
* Adjustable foot rest
* All seats are aligned with windows
* One AC outlet per seat (under armrest)
* Two fold-out trays
* Seat-mounted light switch
* 3.5mm radio jack (not available on all lines)
* Increased crew service (beverage and snack sales)
* Premium floor and seat coverings
* Free snack and drink on selected JR Hokkaido lines

[Here](https://imgcp.aacdn.jp/img-a/1200/auto/global-aaj-front/article/2017/04/58ed8d83816db_58ed8d7216406_955915929.jpg) is an example of a green car on the Tokaido Shinkansen. 

### Are there other options than the expensive, national JR Pass? What about the regional passes I hear about? Would they work better for me?

Each pass other than the main national JR-Pass covers a specific *region*, and any trip leaving that region are not covered. These passes are good if you are planning most of your trip inside such an area. For instance, if you are only staying around Tokyo or Hakodate, consider one of the JR-East passes. If you are staying around Osaka to Fukuoka, a JR-West pass could work. If you plan on traveling between Tokyo and Kyoto, then it might be better check the JR-Pass. Here are some examples:

* Arrival and departure at Tokyo, stay in metropolitan region with optional day-trips to Nikko, Niigata, Sendai or even Hakodate: *JR-East passes might offer the best deal*
* Arrival at Tokyo, only local metro and then move to Kyoto or Osaka, from which you make day-trips on the region like Koya, Nara, Kobe, Himeji, Okayama, Hiroshima, Fukuoka and such, leave the country from Osaka airport: *JR-West passes might offer the best deal* even considering you will pay for the ticket between Tokyo and Kyoto/Osaka yourself
* Arrival and departure at Osaka, with no trips/daytrips east of Kyoto: *JR-West passes might offer the best deal*
* Travel between Tokyo and Kyoto/Osaka twice, or daytrips from Tokyo and Kyoto/Osaka: *The main JR-Pass is probably the best option*

Remember: [calculating all trips and checking against what each pass cover](http://www.jrpass.com/farecalculator) will always be the most accurate way. All these tips and resources are a *good start*, but ultimately you must be sure by your own.

[JR-East](https://www.jreast.co.jp/e/pass/index.html) and [JR-West](https://www.westjr.co.jp/global/en/ticket/pass/) can be purchased online, but they can be purchased inside Japan at a very slight cost increase.

**Note:** there is **no regional pass which covers the Tokaido Shinkansen**. This is one of the most popular routes for tourists as it is between Tokyo/Kyoto/Osaka. If you are taking this route, you will need a full-coverage national JR Pass.

##Using a JR Pass

### Okay, I bought a JR Pass exchange voucher! How do I use it?

It's important to note that you didn't buy a _JR Pass_, you bought an _exchange voucher for a JR Pass_. You'll need to take this voucher with you to Japan and exchange it at a JR Office. [Here](http://www.japanrailpass.net/en/exchange.html) is a list of exchange offices; almost all major airports and cities have exchange offices. Many people opt to get their JR Pass immediately at the airport in order to use it to get from the airport into the city (many cities, including Tokyo, have JR trains from the airport). This is not necessary, though. You can exchange for your pass at any point in your trip that makes sense. 

### Do I need to activate my JR Pass on the day I exchange my voucher? 

No. You can exchange the voucher and set the start date of the JR Pass for any date you want within a one-month period. So if you arrive to Japan on a Sunday, but don't want to use your JR Pass until Thursday, you can exchange for the JR Pass any time between Sunday and Thursday and have the JR Pass set to activate on Thursday. 

### How do I physically use the JR Pass? 

If you are taking local trains, rapid trains, or choosing to sit in a non-reserved car on a Shinkansen train, you can locate the manned ticket gates, display your pass to the worker there, and walk through to the platforms. Manned ticket gates are usually off to the side of automatic ticket gates. See [here](https://cdn5.japanrailpass.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Show-your-Japan-Rail-Pass-at-the-manned-gates-1024x768.jpg) for an example. 

When you leave, you do the exact same thing: walk through a manned ticket gate and display your pass on the way out. 

Sometimes you will be asked to stop and they will inspect your pass more closely, whereas other times they will wave you through.

### When can I start to reserve tickets with my JR Pass?

Once you have your voucher exchanged into a JR Pass, you are able to use it to make seat reservations. Reservations cannot be made until you have your JR Pass in hand, nor can seats be reserved from outside the country.

Furthermore, you can only make seat reservations for the validity of your pass. For example, if you have ordered a 7 day pass and you exchange your voucher into a JR Pass on the 5th of the month for it to begin on the 10th, you can only make seat reservations for departures within the period of the 10th to the 16th of the month. You will not be able to reserve seats for journeys that start before the pass has begun or after the pass has finished.

### Do I always need to reserve seats with the JR Pass? What is this I hear about "reserved cars" and "non-reserved cars"?

Many JR trains are local or rapid trains with no reserved seating at all. They are a lot like rapid metropolitan transportation/subway transportation anywhere around the world.

Reserved seating comes into play with express/Shinkansen trains. Shinkansen trains comes in two flavors: 

* All reserved seating, which means every single seat on the train is assigned to a particular person and you will require seat reservations to travel.
* Mixed cars between reserved seating and non-reserved seating, which means some train cars are "all reserved" and some cars are "non-reserved". Non-reserved cars will be indicated on signage both inside and outside the train.

It is _always_ possible to reserve a seat on a Shinkansen train. If you want to assure yourself a seat on a particular Shinkansen train, you can take your JR Pass to a JR Office and reserve a seat on the train of your choice for free. 

If the Shinkansen you are riding has non-reserved seating available, you can also opt to forgo a seat reservation. Instead, you can just take any free seat in a non-reserved train car. Many people find this convenient because it requires no prior planning and no extra interaction with JR Office staff -- you can just walk right down to the platform at whatever time works best for you and get on the train. At busy times, though, non-reserved cars can fill up so you run risk of not getting very good seating options and the slight risk that the train you want might be full and you'll have to wait for the next one. If you arrive on the platform and their are lines for non-reserved cars, it is common courtesy to stand in line like everyone else.

##Route Planning

### Can I get by with only using a JR Pass for my entire trip?

The short answer is: probably not, but possibly. The JR Pass is mostly useful and valuable for long-distance travel on expensive Shinkansen trains. There are some cities like Tokyo and Osaka where you can get a lot of local, intra-city use out of the JR Pass, but it is unlikely you will be able to get *everywhere* you want to go with just a JR Pass. Many people choose to have an IC Card (see below) in addition to a JR Pass.

### What is an IC Card and what does it have to do with a JR Pass?

An [IC Card](http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2359_003.html) is a prepaid, rechargeable card that is used to pay for subway and train rides, similar to a ClipperCard (San Francisco), MetroCard (NYC), CharlieCard (Boston), OysterCard (London), or OctopusCard (Hong Kong). IC Cards are convenient because you can use them to swipe in and out of subway gates without needing to buy an individual ticket for each ride. They can also be used to purchase goods at vending machines and convenience stores.

IC Cards are completely separate from JR Passes, but many people choose to have both a JR Pass *and* an IC Card, since the IC Card can be used on train systems where the JR Pass isn't valid (any non-JR train system). There are no benefits to having an IC Card beyond the convenience of swiping in and out of subway gates easily.
