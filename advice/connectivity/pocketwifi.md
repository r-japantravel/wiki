#Pocket Wi-Fi and SIM Cards in Japan

Public wi-fi in Japan is generally limited to people who have service with a Japanese cell phone provider. As the 2020 Olympics approaches, public wi-fi connections are becoming more widely available at places like train stations and popular tourists spots — but it’s still hard to find outside major tourist areas. It is best to not rely on public wi-fi accessibility as the connections are unstable, slow and generally unreliable. Because of this, many users who do not have international or favorable roaming plans with their home cell provider opt to rent a **pocket wi-fi** or **SIM card**.

##Which one is best for me?

###Pocket Wi-fi

A popular choice among tourists, especially those traveling as a couple/small group or those without an unlocked cell phone, is **pocket wi-fi**. A pocket wi-fi is a personal hotspot device, about the size of a flip phone, that provides wi-fi access to items such as phones, tablets and laptops via a secured wi-fi network. The devices are rechargeable and, depending on your usage, can use power quickly. Therefore, it is recommended to carry either a portable battery (easily found at any electronics store) or the pocket wi-fi charger on your person during your trip.

Pocket wi-fi can be rented in advance (for airport pickup) or upon arrival in Japan at any major airport. Pocket wi-fi plans are usually tiered by download/upload speed, max number of connected devices and battery life (ie: a 75mbps wi-fi that allows 4 connected devices with a battery life of 10 hours.)

**PROS**

 - More flexible rental terms. You only pay for the number of days needed.

 - Can easily connect any device

 - Can easily connect numerous devices. 

 - Generous data plans and faster speeds — specially when connecting numerous devices. 

 - Set-and-forget. You don't have to constantly re-establish connection with the pocket wi-fi. 

 - Most devices have a broadcast range of 5-10 meters. 

 - Usually higher performance-per-dollar

**CONS**

 - Requires pre-planning and, in most cases, advanced reservations to schedule airport or hotel delivery 

 - Requires carrying an additional device and, if the user chooses, an additional charger

 - For very light individual users, usually more expensive than a basic sim card rental. (Lowest prices are about $30 USD). 

###Sim Card

For travelers with unlocked cell phones, a **SIM card** is an easy option as it allows you to utilize Japanese cell towers without incurring roaming charges and eliminates the need to carry a second device and charger. However, if your phone is on contract with a service provider in your home country (ie: "locked") then you will be unable to use a SIM card in Japan. When renting or buying a SIM, be sure to select the proper SIM card size that is compatible with your phone. Many retailers or service providers do not allow exchanges if the wrong size is purchased.

SIM Cards can either be rented in advance — many pocket wi-fi providers also rent SIM cards — or purchased upon arrival in Japan at the airport or at any major electronics retailer. SIM cards are usually tiered by amount of data and length of validity (ie: a 10GB card good for 14 days).


**PROS**

 - Can buy from vending machines or electronics stores with no prior planning/reservations

 - Lightweight - no impact on baggage, no need to carry additional devices/chargers

 - Many options available 

 - For tech-savvy people it's not too complex to get started

 - For light Internet users, simple plans are available that are cheaper than any pocket wi-fi model (ie: 7 days/1GB/$25 USD)

 - Usually, you can dispose of the SIM card at the end of your trip. No need to worry about return shipping. 

**CONS**

 - Limited options for rental length, usually 7-day, 15-day, 30-day, etc. 

 - Sometimes difficult to set up, either because of compatibility errors with the device/Japan networks or using an unlocked device

 - Not ideal for travelers with multiple devices. Tethering other devices to parent device can drain battery and slow down network. 

 - Compatibility issues are common with foreign phones

 - When connecting numerous devices via tethering, the parent device will disconnect the network if not in active use (ie: "sleep" mode or when the screen is off). Takes extra time to re-broadcast tethering network and then reconnect child devices.
