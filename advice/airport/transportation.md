#Airport Transportation in Japan

##Introduction

For most cities in Japan, there are several options for transit both from and to your airport of choice. Which option is "best" depends on a variety of independent factors that vary between travelers:

* Time (ie: speed of transfer to/from airport)
* Cost
* Comfort 
* Ease of Use

When deciding which method of airport transit to use, please keep in mind that what works best for one traveler might not be best for another. Travelers must consider all aspects of their visit, including location of lodging, amount/weight of baggage and budget. For example:

* Tourists staying in metro Tokyo traveling with small children might prefer the ease of the N'EX, as it provides a direct trip to Tokyo or Shibuya station, followed by a taxi ride to their lodging location.

* Tourists with mobility issues staying at a major hotel serviced by one of the many bus services might prefer this door-to-door transit method, as it requires no luggage handling or walking through train stations.

* Tourists who are confident in their train navigation skills and with light/minimal luggage might prefer taking the Skyliner and a local train to their destination, as it will often require some transfers.

* Tourists on a very tight budget might prefer the ￥1000 buses.

##Tokyo Airports

###Narita Airport to Tokyo

Narita International Airport is 60 km (*37 mi*) from central Tokyo. 

**Taxi** is the most expensive option. A taxi from Narita to the Shibuya or Shinjuku area will cost anywhere from ￥20,000 to ￥25,000 depending on traffic. A taxi to the Tokyo Station area will run anywhere from ￥19,000 to ￥22,000 depending on traffic. Several "flat rate" private hire car services are also available, but the rates for these services are comparable to taxi rates. Without the traffic, the drive time from Narita Airport into metro Tokyo is about 75-100 minutes. During rush hour, this can easily jump to 2 hours or more.

There are two express trains serving Narita: the **Keisei Skyliner** and the **Narita Express**. Both offer ample storage for luggage and are designed for airport travelers with plenty of space.

The **[Keisei Skyliner](http://www.keisei.co.jp/keisei/tetudou/skyliner/us/ae_outline/index.php)** travels between Narita and Ueno Station in about 40 minutes. It is the cheaper of the two express trains — but not by much. The Skyliner is the best option for travelers staying in Akihabara, Ueno and other locations near Tokyo Station. For travelers whose final destination is not near Ueno Station, taking the Keisei Skyliner requires a transfer at either Nippori or Ueno stations — which can be cumbersome for travelers with a lot of luggage or small children and increases the cost of the trip. (Example: A traveler staying in Shinjuku can take the Skyliner to Ueno, and then pay anywhere from ¥200-340 to get from Ueno to Shinjuku, depending on trains used.) [Slightly discounted tickets](http://www.keisei.co.jp/keisei/tetudou/skyliner/e-ticket/en/eticket/index.html) can be purchased online prior to departure, otherwise full fare tickets — ¥2470 for adults, ¥1240 for children — can be purchased at the airport upon arrival. Using an IC Card (PASMO, Suica etc.) discounts the Skyliner fare by ¥5. The last Skyliner departs Narita airport at 22:30 on both weekdays and weekends/holidays. The last Skyliner from Tokyo departs Ueno at 18:20 on both weekdays and weekends/holidays.

The **[Narita Express (N'EX)](http://www.jreast.co.jp/e/nex/)** is a high-speed train that shuttles passengers between Narita Airport and several major stations in the greater Tokyo area including Tokyo, Shibuya, Ikebukuro, Shinjuku and Yokohama. The N'EX arrives at Tokyo station in about 50 minutes and stations in the Shibuya/Shinjuku area in about 70 minutes. Travelers going to Tokyo Station who do not want to transfer from the Skyliner at Ueno and do not mind the negligible cost difference should utilize the N'EX. Travelers staying in Shibuya, Shinjuku and other areas in western metro Tokyo should utilize the N'EX over the Skyliner as you can reach your destination without transferring. [Ticket fare](http://www.jreast.co.jp/e/nex/tickets.html) depends on the passenger's final stop along the N'EX station line. Fares to Tokyo Station are ￥3020; Shinjuku/Shibuya/Shinagawa/Ikebukuro are ￥3190; Yokohama is ￥4290. Child fares are approximately 50% of adult fares and are valid for children ages 6-11; children under 6 are free. A [highly discounted round-trip N'EX ticket](http://www.jreast.co.jp/e/pass/nex_round.html#category05) is available for foreign passport holders and can be purchased upon arrival at Narita Airport at the JR ticket counters. These round-trip passes are ￥4000 for adults and ￥2000 for children, regardless of the destination and departure station. JR Pass holders can ride the N'EX to and from Narita with a valid (activated) pass. The last N'EX departs Narita airport at 21:44 daily. The last N'EX from Shinjuku leaves at 19:39 and from Tokyo station at 20:03.

A slower but more affordable option for travelers staying in East Tokyo is the **[Keisei Access Express](http://www.keisei.co.jp/keisei/tetudou/skyliner/us/nrt_access/index.php)**,  which takes riders from Narita to Asakusa in 51 minutes or Ueno in 41. [Timetables are here](http://www.keisei.co.jp/keisei/tetudou/skyliner/us/timetable/index.php). A one-way ticket for adults costs ￥1330 and ￥670 for children ages 6-11. There is no round-trip discount ticket. If Ueno, Asakusa or one of the other stops listed is not your final destination, you will need to transfer stations, which will require moving luggage, paying additional train fare and increases travel time. (Example: A traveler staying near Tokyo Station utilizing the Keisei Access Express will need to transfer at Ueno, which will require moving luggage and paying ￥160 in additional fares. A traveler staying Shinjuku utilizing the Keisei Access Express would need to pay an additional ￥200 to get from Ueno to Shinjuku. The trip is around 30 minutes, bringing total cost to ￥1530 and total trip time to 75 minutes or more.)

The cheapest (and slowest) train option is the **[Keisei Limited Express](http://www.keisei.co.jp/keisei/tetudou/skyliner/us/nrt_access/tokkyu.php)**, which takes riders from Narita to Ueno Station in 70 minutes. (For reference, this is the same amount of time it takes for the N'EX to reach Shinjuku on the other side of the city.) A one-way ticket for adults costs ￥1030 and ￥520 for children ages 6-11. There is no round-trip discount ticket. If Ueno is not your final destination, you will need to transfer at Ueno, which will require moving luggage, paying additional train fare and increases travel time significantly. (Example: A traveler staying in Shinjuku utilizing the Keisei Limited Express would need to pay an additional ￥200 to get from Ueno to Shinjuku. The trip is around 30 minutes, bringing total cost to ￥1230 and total trip time to 100 minutes or more.) [Timeables are here](http://www.keisei.co.jp/keisei/tetudou/skyliner/us/timetable/index.php).

Because the trains in Japan stop running after a certain time, the **[Airport Limousine Bus](https://www.limousinebus.co.jp/en/)** is a popular option for travelers with late flight arrival times. A one-way ticket to locations within metro Tokyo (Shibuya, Shinjuku, Tokyo Station et al.) is ￥3100 for adults and ￥1550 for children aged 6-12. (Children under 6 years of age are free.) A [round-trip bus pass that allows you to return to the airport for your departure](https://www.limousinebus.co.jp/en/information/visitor_tickets/) is offered for ￥4500 for adults and ￥2250 for children. The Limousine Bus services a wide variety of areas within the greater Tokyo region, including the Tokyo Disney, outer suburbs, and even popular hotels. [Check out the timetables](http://www.limousinebus.co.jp/en/bus_services/) to see if your area is covered and to see individual departure/arrival times. For reference, the last bus to Shinjuku leaves Narita at 23:00 and the last bus to Tokyo Station leaves at 22:50. Most Limousine Buses arrive at their destinations between 80-100 minutes, although traffic and travel to locations outside the 23 Wards can bump this time to 2 hours or more.

The **[Keisei Expressway Bus](http://honyaku.j-server.com/LUCKEISEIB/ns/tl.cgi/http://www.keiseibus.co.jp/kousoku/nrt16.html?SLANG=ja&TLANG=en&XMODE=0&XJSID=0&_ga=2.210257621.1789563385.1497413305-1112552601.1497413305)** is the cheapest Narita transit option, with [advance tickets](http://honyaku.j-server.com/LUCKEISEIB/ns/tl.cgi/http://www.keiseibus.co.jp/kousoku/nrt16_reserve.html?SLANG=ja&TLANG=en&XMODE=0&XCHARSET=utf-8&XJSID=0) costing ￥900. Tickets purchased at the airport cost ￥1000. All child tickets are ￥500. This bus only goes to Tokyo Station, with a select few going to Ginza or Oedo-Onsen Monogatari in Odaiba. The trip length is similar to that of the Limousine Bus and is subject to traffic, so budget anywhere from 75 minutes to 2 hours. The last Keisei bus departs Narita at 23:10.

Another cheap option is **[Access Narita](http://accessnarita.jp/en/home/)** which offers adult tickets for ￥1000 and child tickets for ￥500. This bus only goes to Tokyo Station and Ginza Station. The trip length is similar to that of the Limousine Bus and is subject to traffic, so budget anywhere from 75 minutes to 2 hours. The last Access Narita bus departs Narita at 22:45.

###Haneda Airport to Tokyo

Haneda International Airport is 22 km (*~13 mi*) from central Tokyo. 

**Taxi** is the most expensive option. A taxi from Haneda to the Shibuya or Shinjuku area will cost anywhere from ￥6,200 to ￥9,000 depending on traffic. A taxi to the Tokyo Station area will run anywhere from ￥5,500 to ￥9.000 depending on traffic. Several "flat rate" private hire car services are also available, but the rates for these services are comparable to taxi rates. Without the traffic, the drive time from Haneda Airport into metro Tokyo is about 30-50 minutes. During rush hour, this can easily jump to 70 minutes or more.

There are two train lines servicing Haneda: the **Keikyu Line** and the **Tokyo Monorail**.

Most travelers utilizing the **[Keikyu Line](http://www.haneda-tokyo-access.com/en/transport/)** will transfer at Shinagawa Station. However, select trains on the Keikyu Line also go directly to Yokohama, Asakusa, Higashi-Ginza and Narita Airport. A one-way ticket on the Keikyu Line to Shinagawa Station is ￥410 and takes 11 minutes, while a one-way ticket to Yokohama is ￥450 and takes 23 minutes. Travelers headed to Shinjuku, Shibuya, Tokyo Station, Harajuku or other stations along the JR Yamanote line should transfer to the Yamanote line at Shinagawa. Individual transfer costs will vary, so [see here for specific fare information](http://www.haneda-tokyo-access.com/en/transport/faretable.html). For reference, a traveler going from Haneda to Shinjuku will spend ￥610 in ticket fare and the total trip time will take around 40 minutes. The last Keikyu trains departing Haneda leave at 00:01 on weekdays and 00:02 on weekends and holidays. The last Keikyu trains departing Shinagawa Station are 00:04 on weekdays and 23:42 on weekends and holidays.

The **[Tokyo Monorail](http://www.tokyo-monorail.co.jp/english/haneda-tokyo-access/)** follows a similar procedure to the Keikyu Line. Travelers will board the Monorail at Haneda then transfer to their final destination at Hamamatsucho Station — a stop on the convenient JR Yamanote line. [A one-way ticket](http://www.tokyo-monorail.co.jp/english/guidance/train_info.html) on the Tokyo Monorail to Hamamatsucho Station is ￥490 for adults or ￥250 for children and takes roughly 15 minutes. From Hamamatsucho, individual transfer costs will vary. Travelers landing at Haneda airport on a weekend or holiday can purchase a [discount monorail + Yamanote pass](http://www.tokyo-monorail.co.jp/english/tickets/value/yamanote.html) for ￥500 that covers both the monorail trip and transfer trip to any station along the Yamanote line. (Example: A traveler staying in Shinjuku utilizing the Tokyo Monorail would need to pay an additional ￥200 to get from Hamamatsucho to Shinjuku. The trip is around 20 minutes, bringing total cost to ￥690 and total trip time to around 45-50 minutes.) The last Monorail leaves Haneda's International terminal at 00:10. The last monorail bound for Haneda Airport leaves Hamamatsucho Station at 00:01 on weekdays, as well as weekends and holidays.

Travelers wary of utilizing the train from Haneda, or those who arrive close to midnight, have two bus options: The **Keiyu Kyuko** and the **Limousine Bus**.

The **[Keiyu Kyuko Bus](http://hnd-bus.com/airport/)** runs from Haneda to a variety of locations throughout greater Tokyo including Yokohama and Hakone. [See here for a map of the Keiyu Kyuko stops](http://hnd-bus.com/airport/route/map.html). Please note Shinjuku is not serviced by this bus line, but places like Tokyo Station, Tokyo Disney and Shibuya are. Fares and timetables vary by route, so please check the route list for more information. (For reference, a traveler going to Shibuya can expect to pay ￥1030 yen for adults and ￥520 for children with a total travel time of about 70 minutes.)
