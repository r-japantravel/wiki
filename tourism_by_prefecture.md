##Tourism by Prefecture

Welcome to /r/JapanTravel’s Tourism by Prefecture series. 

This is a series of weekly megathreads grouped by city/prefecture where users can submit their recommendations for things to see and do in that area. The aim of this series is to shine a light on lesser-visited prefectures and sharing hidden gems that you wouldn’t find on other planning resources, such as Japan-Guide. We hope this will become the first stop for users looking for suggestions on what to do or see in a particular area of Japan. 

This series is a work in progress, not all prefectures will have been covered yet. Once each megathread goes live it will be added to this page for quick and easy reference. Please see below for the list of prefectures that have been covered so far:
